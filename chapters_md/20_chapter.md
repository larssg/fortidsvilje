# Chapter 20 — Lake Como, Italy, July 2019

The drive south was beautiful—Switzerland's ordered perfection giving way to Italy's chaotic charm as they crossed at Chiasso and dropped toward the lakes.

Lake Lugano first, glimpsed through tunnels and hairpin turns. Then the descent to Como, the road switchbacking down through forests and villages, their ears popping with the altitude change.

"There it is," Malene said.

Lake Como spread before them, impossibly blue, ringed by mountains that plunged directly into the water. Villas clung to the slopes. Boats traced white wakes across the surface. The afternoon sun turned everything to gold.

"It's beautiful," Ole said. "More beautiful than I imagined."

"And somewhere up there"—Malene gestured toward the mountains to the north—"is a chest full of diamonds."

They followed the coastal road north, passing through villages that seemed unchanged from the 1940s. The same narrow streets. The same stone buildings. The same views that Mussolini had seen on his final journey.

"He drove this road," Ole said. "Jens and Paul, in that black Mercedes. Right here, where we're driving now."

"Seventy-five years ago. And we're about to finish what they started."

Dongo was small—a cluster of buildings along the lakefront, dominated by a white hotel with blue shutters. They parked in a lot near the entrance and sat for a moment, looking at the town.

"This is it," Malene said. "This is where everything happened."

"And where it's going to happen again."

They checked in at the reception, greeted by a middle-aged woman whose smile seemed slightly forced. As they walked toward the elevator, Malene felt a prickle at the back of her neck and turned.

The receptionist was watching them with an expression that wasn't friendly. Something in her eyes—concern? Warning?

Then the elevator doors opened, and the moment passed.

The suite was everything they'd hoped for: spacious, elegant, with a balcony overlooking the lake. A waiter arrived minutes after they did—young, athletic, speaking perfect English—carrying a complimentary bottle of Spumante.

"Welcome to Dongo," he said. "I hope you enjoy your stay."

They drank on the balcony, watching the sun slide toward the mountains.

"Tomorrow," Ole said. "We start looking."

"Tomorrow we're tourists. We drive around, take some hikes, get the lay of the land." Malene touched his hand. "We don't rush. We don't attract attention. We let them think we're just another couple on holiday."

"And when we find the location?"

"Then we plan the extraction. Night work. In and out before anyone notices."

They clinked glasses. The wine was cold and sharp.

"To the treasure," Ole said.

"To us."

They explored the town on foot—a twenty-minute walk that covered most of it. A few restaurants, some shops, a small park by the water where tourists ate gelato in the evening sun.

As they passed through the park, Malene noticed a young man pushing a cleaning cart. He was fit, well-groomed, out of place in a job usually reserved for older workers. When their eyes met, something flickered in his expression—recognition? Hostility?

"Did you see that?" she asked Ole.

"See what?"

"The street sweeper. The way he looked at us."

"I didn't notice anything."

But Malene had noticed. And she filed it away.

Dinner was at the hotel restaurant, at a table with a view of the lake. The same young waiter served them, professional and attentive. A few tables away sat an elderly Italian gentleman, elegantly dressed, dining alone.

He caught their eye and nodded a greeting. When Ole mentioned they were considering the tourist menu, the gentleman leaned over with a smile.

"If you enjoy beef, I recommend the Bistecca alla Fiorentina. The best cut, always."

They chatted briefly—his name was Russo, he was on holiday from Rome, he seemed charming and harmless. They ordered well, ate better, drank excellent wine.

As they left, Russo raised his glass to them.

"Enjoy your stay," he said. "Dongo is a special place."

Something in his tone made Malene uneasy. But she couldn't say why.

The next morning, she woke early and stepped onto the balcony.

Below, in the park by the water, she saw Russo walking slowly, enjoying the morning air. The street sweeper was working nearby, emptying bins and sweeping paths.

Then Russo approached the young man. They began to talk.

Malene watched, fascinated. The conversation grew animated—Russo gesturing, the younger man responding with increasing agitation. Then Russo's expression hardened. He pointed at the street sweeper, clearly giving orders. The young man's posture changed—submissive, almost fearful.

Finally Russo turned and walked away. As he did, he glanced up at the hotel.

Their eyes met.

Russo smiled, tipped his hat, and continued walking.

But Malene had seen his expression before he composed himself. Surprise. And something else.

Calculation.

She stepped back into the room, her heart racing.

"Ole," she said. "We need to talk."

She told him what she'd seen. The conversation in the park. Russo's reaction when he spotted her watching.

Ole listened carefully. Then: "It could be nothing. A local he knows. An argument about something unrelated."

"It wasn't nothing. The street sweeper was terrified of him. And Russo—when he saw me watching—he looked like a man caught doing something he shouldn't."

"What do you want to do?"

Malene thought about it. They'd come so far. The treasure was within reach. Walking away now would mean giving up everything.

"We continue," she said. "But we're careful. We watch for anything else unusual. And if there's any sign we're being followed, any sign at all, we leave immediately."

"Agreed."

They went down to breakfast, acting like nothing was wrong. Russo was nowhere to be seen.

But when they collected their car and drove north toward the mountains, Malene couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.

The day was uneventful on the surface—driving through villages, hiking short trails, playing the tourist. But underneath, both of them were on edge.

That evening, as they changed for dinner, Ole said: "Tomorrow we go to Garzeno. See if we can spot the stone house."

"Already?"

"The sooner we know, the sooner we can plan. I don't want to spend two weeks here if there's nothing to find."

Malene nodded. "Garzeno tomorrow. And we keep our eyes open."

They dined at a restaurant in the town square, away from the hotel. Away from Russo and the watching eyes.

But as they walked back in the evening darkness, Malene saw the street sweeper again, standing in a doorway, watching them pass.

He made no effort to hide.

She took Ole's hand and walked faster.

Whatever was happening here, they weren't imagining it.

The question was what to do about it.
