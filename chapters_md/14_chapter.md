# Chapter 14 — Denmark To Germany, July 2019

They left Copenhagen on a Wednesday morning, the sun already warm on the Porsche's silver hood. Malene drove the first leg, guiding them through the light traffic, across Zealand, and onto the Great Belt Bridge.

The bridge was spectacular in the clear weather—the suspension cables sweeping overhead, the water glittering far below, the view stretching from Langeland in the south to Kerteminde in the north. Ole, who had never crossed it in a car, found himself pressing against the window like a child.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Malene said.

"I never knew."

"That's the problem with always taking the train. You miss things."

They drove in comfortable silence across Funen, the countryside rolling past in shades of green and gold. Summer in Denmark, everything lush and growing.

"Nervous?" Malene asked.

"A little. You?"

"Terrified." She smiled. "But in a good way. Like before a roller coaster."

"I've never liked roller coasters."

"Then this should be interesting."

Odense appeared in the early afternoon—the familiar streets, the mix of old and new, the spires of St. Canute's Cathedral rising above the rooftops.

"Turn here," Ole said. "Then left at the light."

The neighborhood where he'd grown up was quieter than he remembered. The houses looked smaller, the streets narrower. Everything seemed to have shrunk in the years since he'd left.

His father's house stood at the end of a cul-de-sac—a two-story villa from the 1920s, painted yellow, with a black tile roof and dormers in the attic. It had been handsome once. Now it just looked tired.

"The paint is peeling," Malene observed.

"It's been peeling for years. Father didn't have the energy to maintain it. Not after he got sick."

They parked in the carport and let themselves in through the front door. The house was empty—completely empty, stripped of everything but the walls and floors. Without furniture to distract the eye, the decay was impossible to ignore: moisture stains in the corners, yellowed wallpaper, floors black with age.

"It's sad," Malene said. "You can see it was beautiful once."

"The new owners are going to renovate it. Flip it, probably. That's what the agent said."

They walked through the rooms, Ole's footsteps echoing in the emptiness. The kitchen where his mother had made breakfast. The living room where his father had sat alone for twenty-five years. The study where the business accounts had been kept in perfect order, even as everything else fell apart.

"The guest room is upstairs," he said. "That's where I found it."

The room under the eaves was smaller than he remembered. The knee wall where the bookcase had stood. The small door, visible now, no longer hidden.

Malene crouched and looked into the crawl space. "Dark. I can't see anything."

Ole handed her a flashlight. She shone it into the shadows—empty now, nothing but dust and cobwebs and the faint smell of old wood.

"Strange to think about," she said. "All those years. The suitcase just sitting here, waiting."

"Sixty-seven years. Since 1952."

"And no one knew."

"No one knew."

They stood in silence for a moment, contemplating the empty space where everything had begun.

"We should go," Ole said finally. "We have a long drive ahead."

He dropped the keys in the mailbox on their way out. The house belonged to someone else now. That chapter was closed.

The drive across southern Denmark was uneventful—rolling farmland, small towns, the occasional wind turbine turning lazily against the sky. They crossed the border into Germany without stopping, the old customs buildings abandoned and overgrown.

"Remember when you had to show your passport here?" Malene said.

"Barely. I was young."

"It's better this way. No borders, no checkpoints. Just drive."

They stopped for lunch at a rest area near Rendsburg—a mistake, it turned out. The cafeteria was grim, the food worse. Malene's schnitzel was cold and tough; Ole's currywurst was swimming in grease.

"We should have checked Tripadvisor," Malene said, pushing her plate away.

"Lesson learned."

"At least we won't starve. Probably."

They got back on the road, crossing the Kiel Canal on a high bridge, the ships passing below like toys. The autobahn stretched ahead, three lanes wide, almost empty.

"This is where it gets interesting," Malene said. "No speed limit."

"I'm aware."

"Want to see what the car can do?"

"Not particularly."

She pressed the accelerator anyway.

The Porsche surged forward, the engine note rising from a purr to a roar. The speedometer climbed—160, 180, 200. The landscape began to blur at the edges.

Ole gripped the door handle. "This is faster than I've ever traveled in a car."

"This is what the car was built for." Malene was grinning, her eyes bright. "Feel that? The way it handles? Like it's on rails."

220 kilometers per hour. The world outside had become a smear of color and motion.

"I think I'm going to be sick," Ole said.

Malene laughed and eased off the accelerator. The car slowed gradually, the engine settling back into its steady rumble.

"That was fun."

"For you, maybe."

"You'll learn to love it. By the time we get to Italy, you'll be begging to drive fast."

Ole doubted that very much.

Lübeck appeared in the late afternoon—the famous Holstentor rising above the old city, the church spires reaching toward the sky. They parked in a garage near the center and walked to their hotel, bags in hand.

The streets were crowded with tourists—shoulder to shoulder in places, blocking the sidewalks, posing for photographs in front of every picturesque doorway. Malene sighed.

"It's like Venice," she said. "You can barely move."

"It should thin out by evening. The day-trippers will leave."

The hotel was modern, clean, efficient—a three-story building across from the Marienkirche. Their room was on the second floor, with a view of a small plaza and a cultural center that looked newer than everything around it.

"Rebuilt after the bombing," Malene said, reading Ole's mind. "Half the city was destroyed during the war."

"You can't tell, walking around."

"That's the point. They wanted it to look like nothing had happened. Like they could erase the past by rebuilding the buildings."

She sat on the edge of the bed and looked at him. "You only booked one room."

Ole felt heat rise to his face. "I didn't think—I mean, I can get another—"

"I'm not complaining." She smiled. "Just observing."

"I can go down and ask—"

"Ole. Stop." She patted the bed beside her. "Sit down. Relax. We've been dancing around this for months. Maybe it's time to stop dancing."

He sat. She took his hand.

"Whatever happens in Italy," she said, "whatever we find or don't find—I'm glad we're doing this together."

"So am I."

"Good." She leaned in and kissed him. "Now let's go see the city before all the tourists eat everything."

They spent the evening wandering through Lübeck's medieval streets, admiring the restored merchant houses, the massive churches, the quiet squares. The crowds thinned as the day-trippers departed, and by dusk they had the old city almost to themselves.

Dinner was at the Schiffergesellschaft—a restaurant that had been serving sailors and merchants since the sixteenth century. The ceiling was hung with model ships and chandeliers; the tables were long wooden affairs where strangers sat elbow to elbow.

"German cooking," Ole said happily, studying the menu. "Real German cooking. Sausages and cabbage and potatoes."

"I'll have the fish."

They ate until they couldn't eat anymore, then walked slowly back to the hotel, holding hands in the warm summer darkness.

That night, in the hotel room, they found their way back to each other. It felt familiar and new at the same time—the geography of their bodies remembered, but the people inhabiting them changed by the years apart.

Afterward, lying in the darkness, Malene said: "What do we do when we get to Koblenz?"

"Find Florinspfaffengasse. See if the Fleischer family still lives there."

"And if they do?"

"Then we have a decision to make."

She was quiet for a moment. "The letter said half the treasure belongs to them."

"I know."

"That's a lot of money to give away."

"I know that too."

"But you want to do it anyway."

Ole thought about Jens Raben—the young man in the photograph, the SS soldier who had stolen a dictator's diamonds and buried them in the mountains. The man who had made a promise to a dying friend and spent his final years trying to keep it.

"He gave his word," Ole said. "That has to mean something."

"Even seventy-five years later? Even from a man who did terrible things?"

"Maybe especially then." He turned to look at her in the darkness. "Everyone has something they need to make right. Some debt they need to pay. Maybe this is his."

"And if the family is gone? If we can't find them?"

"Then we'll find another way. A charity, a foundation, something that honors the intention if not the letter."

Malene was silent for a long time. Then she said: "You're a better person than I am, Ole Henriksen."

"I don't think that's true."

"It is." She kissed him softly. "And I love you for it."

He held her until she fell asleep, then lay awake for a long time, thinking about the road ahead.

Koblenz tomorrow. Then Italy. Then the treasure—or the discovery that there was no treasure, that it had all been a fantasy, a dead man's delusion.

Either way, everything would be different after.

He closed his eyes and tried to sleep.

The next morning, they rose early, ate a solid German breakfast, and walked to the parking garage. Ole retrieved the pistol from his bag and slid it under the passenger seat, into a small pocket he'd found in the upholstery.

"Hidden?" Malene asked.

"As hidden as I can make it."

"And the keys?"

"Taped under the seat. You'd have to know they were there to find them."

She nodded, satisfied. "Then let's go find the Fleischer family."

They pulled out of the garage and onto the autobahn, heading south toward Koblenz and whatever waited for them there.

Behind them, three cars back, a dark sedan pulled out and followed at a careful distance.

Neither of them noticed.
