# Chapter 18 — Lake Como, Italy, July 2019

The road from Milan was straight as a ruler, cutting through industrial sprawl that seemed to stretch forever—factories, warehouses, the machinery of modern Italy grinding away in the summer heat.

Russo sat in the back of the Fiat Tipo, watching the landscape without seeing it. His mind was elsewhere, running through scenarios, calculating odds, anticipating problems.

The driver was young, silent, competent. The passenger beside him was the same. True believers, both of them. They would do what needed to be done.

At Como, they left the autobahn and joined the coastal road that wound along the lake's western shore. The pace slowed immediately—buses, trucks, tourists in rental cars, all of them crawling along the narrow ribbon of asphalt that connected the villages.

Russo forced himself to be patient. To appreciate the view—the lake shimmering blue-green in the afternoon light, the mountains rising steep and green on all sides, the elegant villas of the wealthy perched on cliffs and promontories.

Beautiful country. Italian country. And when the movement rose again, it would belong to Italians alone.

Dongo was a small town, unremarkable except for its history. This was where Mussolini had been captured, where the dream of fascist Italy had died in a hail of partisan bullets.

And this was where that dream would be reborn.

The hotel was modest—four stories, white walls, blue shutters, a restaurant on the ground floor. Russo had the driver drop him at the entrance and dismissed both men immediately. The fewer people who saw him, the better.

The manager was waiting—one of theirs, a loyalist who'd been on the payroll for thirty years. He showed Russo to the best room, top floor, view of the lake.

"The Danes?"

"Not yet arrived. Expected this evening."

"The team?"

"In position. One working as a waiter here. The other as a street sweeper. They'll have eyes on the targets at all times."

Russo nodded. "No contact until I give the order. We watch. We wait. We let them lead us to the treasure."

"Understood."

He unpacked methodically, hanging his suits, arranging his toiletries, maintaining the discipline that had served him for sixty years. Then he stood on the balcony with a cigarette and watched the lake turn gold in the evening light.

His phone rang.

"They've arrived in Italy. Crossed at Chiasso two hours ago. Should be with you within the hour."

"Any stops along the way?"

"None. They drove straight through from Koblenz."

"And Koblenz? What did they do there?"

"They visited Florinspfaffengasse. Walked the street multiple times. Spoke to an elderly woman outside the Catholic church."

Russo felt his pulse quicken. "Do we know what they discussed?"

"No. But after the conversation, they went directly to number twelve. Stood outside for several minutes, looking at the building."

Number twelve. Paul Fleischer's address. The address that had been in their files for seventy-five years.

"They know," Russo said. "They know everything."

"It appears so."

He ended the call and lit another cigarette, his hands trembling slightly. Not from fear—from excitement.

Seventy-five years. Three generations of searching, waiting, hoping. And now the end was in sight.

The Porsche appeared at six-fifteen, sliding into the small parking lot beside the hotel. Russo watched from his balcony as two figures emerged—a man and a woman, both fair-haired, both carrying small bags.

The Danes.

They looked ordinary. Tourists on holiday, nothing more. They had no idea they were being watched. No idea that the waiter who would serve them dinner tonight was a trained operative, that the street sweeper outside was reporting their every movement, that the elderly gentleman on the top floor was planning to take everything they'd come for.

Russo smiled.

Let them search. Let them find the treasure. And then—when they thought they were safe, when they were alone and vulnerable—he would strike.

He dined at nine, as was proper. The tourist menu was an insult—cheap pasta, overcooked meat, industrial ice cream—so he ordered properly: risotto with bone marrow, bistecca alla Fiorentina, a selection of cheeses. With it, a bottle of Barolo that cost more than most of the other diners spent on their entire meals.

The Danes arrived shortly after he sat down. They were shown to a table nearby—close enough that he could observe them, far enough that they wouldn't feel watched.

They were attractive, he had to admit. Healthy, fit, clearly comfortable with each other. A couple in love, perhaps. Or at least in something.

Russo caught the woman's eye and nodded politely. She smiled back—automatic politeness, the response of someone who saw an elderly gentleman dining alone and felt a moment of sympathy.

Little did she know.

They ordered wine, then food. They talked quietly, intimately, their heads often close together. Planning, probably. Discussing what they would do tomorrow, where they would search, how they would find the treasure that had eluded so many for so long.

Russo ate slowly, savoring each bite, enjoying the anticipation. Tomorrow would bring the beginning of the end.

Tonight, there was only the pleasure of knowing that he was close—so close—to fulfilling the promise he'd made to his father on his deathbed.

Find the treasure. Restore the movement. Make Italy great again.

It would happen.

It was already happening.

After dinner, he returned to his room and made calls.

The team was ready. Two men, young and capable, willing to do whatever was necessary. They had instructions: watch the Danes, report their movements, wait for the order to move.

No violence until the treasure was found. That was essential. If they struck too early, before the Danes had led them to the hiding place, all would be lost.

But once the chest was in hand—once the diamonds were secured—then the Danes would be dealt with. Quickly, cleanly, permanently.

No witnesses. No loose ends.

Russo poured himself a grappa and stood at the window, looking out at the lake. The water was black now, reflecting the lights of the town, the distant glow of other villages along the shore.

Somewhere out there, buried in the mountains, was a fortune that had been waiting seventy-five years to be claimed.

Tomorrow, the search would begin.

And when it ended, everything would change.

Russo raised his glass to the darkness.

"To the Duce," he said softly. "And to what comes next."

He drank.

Tomorrow.

Everything would happen tomorrow.
