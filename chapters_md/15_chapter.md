# Chapter 15 — Rome, Italy, July 2019

The afternoon heat lay heavy on the city, and Russo sat in his office with the shutters drawn, a single lamp burning on his desk. He was waiting, and he was not a patient man.

The phone rang.

He let it ring twice before answering. "Yes?"

"News from Copenhagen." The voice was clipped, professional. "The Danes left yesterday. They're driving south in the Porsche. Our team is following at a safe distance."

"Where are they now?"

"Lübeck last night. They should reach Koblenz today, then Italy tomorrow."

"Koblenz." Russo made a note. "Why Koblenz?"

"We don't know yet. Possibly just a convenient stopping point."

But Russo knew why. Florinspfaffengasse. The Fleischer family. If the Danes were stopping in Koblenz, they were looking for Paul Fleischer's descendants.

Which meant they knew the whole story. Which meant the treasure was real.

"What else?"

"The genealogical investigation is nearly complete. The man's grandmother had a brother named Jens Raben. He disappeared from Danish records in 1940—no death certificate, no emigration papers, nothing. But we found him in the German archives."

Russo leaned forward. "Go on."

"Jens Raben enlisted in the Waffen-SS in 1941. Served with the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Last posting: Northern Italy, April 1945."

The same division. The same place. The same time.

"That's him," Russo said. "That's the unknown soldier."

"It appears so."

"What happened to him after the war?"

"The German records end in April 1945. But we've found something else—a Danish prison record. Jens Raben was held in a Danish internment camp from 1945 to 1949. War crimes investigation, apparently, though he was never charged with anything specific."

"And after that?"

"He returned to Odense. Lived there until 1952, when he died during a surgical procedure. Heart surgery. He was thirty-two."

Russo sat back in his chair. The picture was becoming clear now. Jens Raben had stolen the treasure, buried it in the mountains, and then spent years in prison camps. By the time he was free, it must have seemed too dangerous to go back. Too many people watching. Too many questions.

So he'd written a letter. Hidden it with his belongings. And waited for the surgery that would either give him a second chance or end his life.

It had ended his life.

But the letter had survived. And now, sixty-seven years later, his descendants were on their way to dig up what he'd buried.

"What about the archivist?" Russo asked. "The one who ran the investigation?"

A pause. "Handled. Traffic accident. It will be in the papers tomorrow."

"Good." Russo felt no emotion about this. The man had been a loose end. Loose ends were dangerous. "What about surveillance on the Danes?"

"Continuous. We know where they are at all times."

"And the team in Dongo?"

"In position. Four men, waiting for your orders."

Russo considered his options. He could have the Danes intercepted now—kidnapped, interrogated, forced to reveal everything they knew. But that was risky. They might not know the exact location. They might have safeguards in place, information stored with lawyers or friends. Better to let them do the work, let them find the treasure, and then take it from them.

"Maintain surveillance," he said. "Do nothing until they reach Dongo. When they start searching, I want to know immediately."

"Understood."

"And book me a flight to Milan. I want to be there when it happens."

He hung up and sat alone in the darkness, savoring the moment.

Seventy-five years. Three generations of searching, watching, waiting. And now, finally, the end was in sight.

The flight to Milan was uneventful. A driver met him at the airport—a young man with a shaved head and the dead eyes of a true believer. They drove north along the lake, past the villages where Mussolini had made his final journey, past the place where he'd been captured and executed.

Russo had made this pilgrimage before. Every few years, he came here to pay his respects. To remember what had been lost. To renew his commitment to the cause.

But this time was different. This time, he wasn't just visiting the past. He was here to reclaim it.

The hotel in Dongo was small and old-fashioned—the kind of place where tourists stayed when they wanted to escape the crowds at Como. The manager was one of theirs, a sympathizer who'd been on the payroll for thirty years. He greeted Russo with the appropriate deference and showed him to the best room.

"The Danes arrived this morning," he said. "They've taken a room on the second floor. So far, they've done nothing but walk around the town and eat lunch."

"Keep watching. Report anything unusual."

"Of course."

Russo stood at the window, looking out at the lake. The water was blue and calm, the mountains rising green and steep on all sides. A beautiful place. A peaceful place.

But not for long.

That evening, he met with the team.

There were four of them—young men in their twenties and thirties, fit, alert, dedicated to the cause. They had been briefed on the basics: two Danish tourists, a possible treasure, the need for discretion.

"No violence until I give the order," Russo said. "We watch. We wait. We let them find what they're looking for. And then we take it."

"What if they resist?" one of the men asked.

"Then we use whatever force is necessary." Russo looked around the room. "But I want them alive until we have the treasure. After that... we'll see."

"And if someone else interferes? Police, bystanders?"

"Handle it. Quietly, if possible. But the treasure is the priority. Everything else is secondary."

The men nodded. They understood.

Russo dismissed them and sat alone in his room, drinking wine and watching the darkness gather over the lake.

Somewhere out there, the Danes were planning their next move. Studying maps, perhaps. Reviewing the letter they'd found in that hidden suitcase. Getting ready to dig up a fortune that had been buried for seventy-five years.

They had no idea they were being watched. No idea that every step they took was being tracked, every word they spoke potentially recorded. No idea that they were walking into a trap.

Russo smiled and raised his glass to the darkness.

"To the Duce," he said softly. "And to the treasure he left behind."

He drank.

Tomorrow, everything would begin.
