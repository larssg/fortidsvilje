# Chapter 8 — Funen, Denmark, April 2019

The train slid across the Great Belt Bridge, sunlight fracturing on the water below. Ole watched the suspension cables sweep past and tried to calm his nerves.

"You're fidgeting," Malene said.

"I'm not fidgeting."

"You've checked your phone four times in the last ten minutes."

Ole put the phone in his pocket. "I'm just... it's strange, isn't it? Finding out your father had this whole secret life. A sports car. Stored on Funen. For years."

"People have secrets." Malene shrugged. "Even boring people. Especially boring people, maybe. They need something to make life interesting."

"My father wasn't boring. He was just... quiet."

"Same thing, to the outside world."

They changed trains in Odense, grabbing sandwiches from a kiosk on the platform. The local train to Aarup was nearly empty—two cars, a handful of passengers, the gentle rhythm of Danish countryside scrolling past the windows.

Ole called Arne when they were ten minutes out. "We're almost there."

"I'll meet you at the station. You can't miss me—I'm the one with the Cadillac."

He wasn't exaggerating.

The car was enormous—a 1960s convertible, black as midnight, chrome gleaming in the afternoon sun. It looked like something from an old Hollywood movie, completely out of place in this quiet Danish town.

The man leaning against it matched the car: large, weathered, comfortable in his own skin. He wore oil-stained jeans and a faded work shirt, and when he smiled, the lines around his eyes deepened into something genuine.

"You must be Ole." He extended a calloused hand. "Arne Brix. Sorry about your father."

"Thank you."

"He was a good man. Quiet, but good. Came out every month or so during the summer, took the car for a spin, had lunch somewhere nice. Always seemed happy when he was behind the wheel." Arne's smile faded slightly. "I think that car meant a lot to him."

Ole didn't know what to say to that. He'd barely known his father at all, it seemed.

"Hop in," Arne said, gesturing to the Cadillac. "Back seat's the best—you get the full convertible experience without the wind in your face."

The leather was soft and warm from the sun. Malene slid in beside Ole, and Arne pulled out of the station parking lot with the easy confidence of a man who'd been driving for fifty years.

"First time in an American car?" he asked over his shoulder.

"First time in anything like this," Ole admitted.

"They don't make them like this anymore. Too heavy, too thirsty, too impractical. But God, they're comfortable."

He wasn't wrong. The Cadillac floated over the roads like a boat on calm water, the suspension absorbing every bump and ripple. Ole found himself relaxing despite his nerves.

The salvage yard was on the outskirts of town, behind a chain-link fence. From outside, it looked like exactly what it was—a place where old cars came to die. But Arne led them past the rusting hulks to a large steel building at the back of the property.

"Climate-controlled storage," he said, producing a key. "Your father paid extra for it. Said he wanted the car kept perfect."

The building was immaculate inside—polished concrete, fluorescent lights, a row of vehicles under canvas covers. Most of the spaces were empty now, their owners having collected their cars for the summer season.

One car remained.

Arne walked to the far corner and pulled back the cover with a theatrical flourish.

The Porsche gleamed.

It was silver—a pure, liquid silver that seemed to glow under the lights. Low and aggressive, with the distinctive sloping rear that defined the 911 shape. Even standing still, it looked fast.

"1989 Carrera," Arne said. "3.6 liter flat-six, 250 horsepower. One of the last air-cooled models before they switched to water cooling. Your father bought it about three years ago. I helped him find it in Germany."

Ole walked around the car slowly, running his hand along the fender. The paint was flawless. The chrome sparkled. Someone had clearly spent hours—days—making sure every surface was perfect.

"What's it worth?" he heard himself ask.

"If you wanted to sell it today? Eight hundred thousand kroner, maybe more. The air-cooled models are getting collectible."

Eight hundred thousand. For a car his father had never mentioned.

Malene opened the driver's door and slid into the seat. Her hands found the steering wheel, and a smile spread across her face.

"This is beautiful."

"Your father felt the same way," Arne said. "Said he'd always wanted a sports car. Decided if he was going to do it, he'd better do it before he got too old."

Ole thought about his father—the quiet jeweler, the man who ate dinner alone every night, who never complained about his son's absence, who kept his dreams hidden away like everything else.

A secret Porsche. A secret life.

What else hadn't he known?

Arne handled the paperwork in the office—a cluttered room that served as workspace, kitchen, and break room all in one. The invoice came to five thousand kroner: storage fees, insurance, an annual service.

"I had her completely checked over," Arne explained. "Oil change, brake fluid, the works. She's been sitting all winter, so I wanted to make sure everything was perfect before you took her out."

Ole paid without complaint. Whatever his father had been, he'd clearly cared about this car. The least Ole could do was honor that.

Back in the storage building, Arne settled into the driver's seat and turned the key.

The engine came alive with a sound Ole had never heard before—a deep, mechanical growl that vibrated through the concrete floor and settled somewhere in his chest. Not the smooth purr of a modern car, but something rawer. More alive.

Arne eased the Porsche out of the building and into the afternoon sunlight. The silver paint blazed.

"She's all yours," Arne said, climbing out. "Remember—engine's in the back, trunk's in the front. Takes some getting used to. And the clutch is stiffer than what you're probably used to."

Malene was already in the driver's seat before Ole could object.

"I'll drive," she said. "You haven't been behind a wheel in years. No point learning on a car that costs more than most apartments."

Ole didn't argue. He settled into the passenger seat, feeling the firm grip of the leather, the low seating position that made the world look different.

Malene engaged the clutch, found first gear, and pulled out of the salvage yard.

"Wave goodbye to Arne," she said.

Ole waved. Arne waved back.

And then they were on the road, the engine settling into a steady rumble behind them, the Danish countryside unrolling ahead.

The highway was smooth and empty. Malene kept to the speed limit, getting a feel for the car—the heavier steering, the stiffer clutch, the way the rear-mounted engine changed the balance.

"It's different," she said. "More mechanical. You can feel everything the car is doing."

"Is that good?"

"It's honest." She downshifted for a curve, and the engine note dropped. "Modern cars hide everything from you. This one tells you the truth."

They drove in silence for a while. Other cars passed them, drivers craning their necks to look. A truck driver gave them a thumbs-up.

"We could drive this to Italy," Malene said.

"What?"

"Think about it. We need a way to get the chest out of the country, assuming we find it. We can't fly with thirty kilograms of diamonds. But if we drive down, drive back—we're just tourists on a road trip. The car is the perfect cover."

"It's not exactly inconspicuous."

"It's exactly inconspicuous. A silver Porsche with Danish plates, driving through the Alps in summer? Nobody will look twice. We'll blend in with every other wealthy tourist."

Ole considered this. She wasn't wrong.

"And the gun?"

"Hidden compartment somewhere. Behind a panel, in the spare tire well. These old cars are full of spaces where things can disappear."

"You've thought about this."

"I've thought about nothing else for days." Malene glanced at him. "Two hundred and fifty million euros, Ole. That's not money. That's a different life. That's everything."

He watched the flat green landscape roll past—fields, farmhouses, wind turbines turning slowly against the pale sky.

"What do we do when we get to Copenhagen?"

"We plan. Maps, satellite images, contingencies. We figure out exactly where we're going and exactly how we're getting the chest out. And we don't tell anyone."

"What about the Fleischer family?"

Malene's jaw tightened. "What about them?"

"The letter said half the treasure belongs to them."

"The letter said a lot of things. It was written by a dying SS soldier seventy years ago." She accelerated past a slower car, the engine roaring. "Let's find the chest first. Then we can worry about who deserves what."

It wasn't an answer. But Ole let it go.

They reached Copenhagen as the sun was setting, the city spreading out before them in a maze of old buildings and narrow streets. Malene navigated by memory, finding her way to Heimdalsgade and the rented garage without needing GPS.

The space was small but secure—a converted warehouse with individual lockups, each one accessible only by key. Malene pulled the Porsche inside, and they sat for a moment in the sudden silence.

"So," she said. "We have a car. We have a destination. We have a plan—sort of."

"And we have two months to get ready."

"Which means starting now." She turned to face him. "Tomorrow we buy equipment. Hiking gear, tools, everything we need to look like tourists who are going hiking in the Italian Alps."

"And the research?"

"I'll handle that. Maps, satellite imagery, anything I can find about the area around Dongo. We need to know exactly what we're walking into."

Ole nodded. Outside the garage, the city was coming alive for the evening—people heading to restaurants, bars, theaters. Normal people, living normal lives.

"This is really happening," he said. "We're really doing this."

"We're really doing this." Malene opened her door. "Go home, get some sleep. Tomorrow we start preparing."

She walked him back to his apartment building, and they stood awkwardly on the sidewalk for a moment.

"Saturday," she said. "We meet Saturday to go over everything. And Ole?"

"Yes?"

"Don't tell anyone. Not your friends, not your colleagues, nobody. As far as the world is concerned, we're just planning a vacation."

She turned and walked away before he could respond.

Ole watched her go, then climbed the stairs to his apartment. The suitcase was where he'd left it, sitting on the table like a patient animal.

He opened it and looked at the contents. The uniform. The pistol. The Soldbuch with its photograph of a smiling young man.

His grandmother's brother. A thief. A killer. A man who'd buried a fortune and never gone back for it.

In two months, Ole would finish what Jens Raben had started.

He closed the suitcase and went to bed.
