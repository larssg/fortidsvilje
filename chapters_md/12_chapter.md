# Chapter 12 — Rome, Italy, June 2019

The phone rang in the darkened sitting room. Marco answered it as always—silent, listening, a single word of thanks—and then walked the length of the corridor to Russo's office.

"News from Copenhagen, signore."

Russo looked up from the documents spread across his desk. "And?"

"They've made progress. Permission to speak freely?"

"Go ahead."

Marco closed the door behind him. "Our people broke into the woman's apartment while she was at work. Tourist brochures about Lake Como. Maps of the region. Nothing unusual for a holidaymaker."

"And the man?"

"More interesting. They found an Iron Cross—First Class, genuine—displayed on a shelf. And in a drawer, a magazine for a Walther P38."

Russo set down his pen. "A pistol magazine. Without the pistol."

"Correct. The rest of the apartment was unremarkable. He subscribes to intellectual newspapers, owns books about history and mathematics. Not the profile of a typical war memorabilia collector."

"What do we know about him?"

"A high school teacher, like the woman. They're not employed at the same school, but they appear to be... close. They've been seen driving together in a Porsche 911—a recent inheritance from his father."

"His father."

"Deceased. Left a considerable estate. The son comes from a city called Odense, moved to Copenhagen twenty years ago." Marco paused. "There's more. The woman appears to suspect she's being watched. She's been exhibiting signs of anxiety—looking over her shoulder, changing routes, that sort of thing."

Russo leaned back in his chair. "Pull back the surveillance on her. We don't want to spook them before they leave. Focus on the man."

"Understood."

"And I want a GPS tracker on that Porsche. If they're driving to Italy, I want to know every kilometer they travel."

"It will be done."

"One more thing." Russo opened a drawer and withdrew a leather notebook. "I want a full genealogical investigation. The man's family, going back to the war. If there's a connection to the German military—Wehrmacht, SS, anything—I want to know about it."

Marco nodded and withdrew.

Russo sat alone in the silence, turning the information over in his mind.

An Iron Cross. A pistol magazine. A trip to Dongo.

It could still be coincidence. A history enthusiast with inherited memorabilia, visiting a historically significant location. It happened.

But his instincts said otherwise.

He summoned the inner circle that evening.

The five men gathered in the meeting room as always—Giancarlo with his cane, the younger members with their expensive suits and careful expressions, the portrait of Mussolini watching from above the fireplace.

Russo laid out the evidence. The hotel booking. The surveillance results. The Iron Cross.

"It's circumstantial," one of the younger men said. "We've had false alarms before."

"We have," Russo agreed. "But consider the pattern. Two Danes—and we've always known the second soldier was Danish. A fourteen-day booking in Dongo—far longer than any tourist would need. War memorabilia in the man's apartment, including a pistol magazine without the pistol." He paused. "Somewhere, there's a Walther P38 with a full magazine waiting to be reunited with that spare."

Giancarlo rapped his cane against the floor. "What are you proposing?"

"Escalation. I want wiretaps on both apartments. I want the GPS tracker installed immediately. And I want the genealogical investigation expedited—if there's a family connection to the war, I want to know within the week."

"And when they arrive in Italy?"

"We'll be ready. I want a team in Dongo before they arrive. Young men, strong, willing to do what's necessary." Russo looked around the table. "This is what we've been waiting for, gentlemen. Seventy-five years of patience, and now—perhaps—the moment has come."

"Perhaps," the lawyer said. "You keep saying perhaps."

"Because I'm not a fool. I don't count treasures before they're found." Russo's voice hardened. "But I do prepare. And I expect all of you to do the same."

The vote was unanimous. Resources would be allocated. Men would be positioned. The trap would be set.

All they needed now was for the Danes to walk into it.

After the others left, Russo poured himself a whiskey and stood at the window, looking out at the Roman night.

He thought about his father, who had started this search in the years after the war. About his grandfather, who had been one of Mussolini's inner circle before everything collapsed. About the generations of true believers who had kept the faith alive through decades of defeat and disgrace.

The treasure wasn't just money. It was validation. Proof that the cause had been worth fighting for, that the sacrifices hadn't been in vain.

Two hundred and fifty million euros. Enough to fund operations for decades. Enough to buy politicians, newspapers, influence. Enough to make fascism more than a historical curiosity—to make it a living force again.

All they needed was for two Danish schoolteachers to dig up a chest that had been buried for seventy-five years.

And then to take it from them.

Russo smiled and raised his glass to the darkness.

"Soon," he said softly. "Soon."

The next morning, he made the necessary calls.

Two more operatives would fly to Copenhagen within the week. Professionals—not the embassy amateurs, but men who knew how to conduct surveillance without being detected.

The wiretaps would be installed within forty-eight hours. Every conversation in both apartments would be recorded, transcribed, analyzed.

The genealogical investigation would be handled by a specialist firm in Berlin—expensive, but thorough. If the man's family had any connection to the German military, they would find it.

And in Dongo, preparations would begin. A safe house rented. A team assembled. Equipment procured.

Everything would be ready.

When the Danes arrived, they would think they were hunters.

They wouldn't realize they were prey.

Russo spent the rest of the day reviewing the organization's finances. The Dongo operation was expensive—surveillance, travel, bribes, equipment—but the potential return justified the investment.

Besides, they had other income streams. Donations from wealthy sympathizers. Revenue from legitimate businesses. The occasional discreet transaction that didn't bear close scrutiny.

Fascism, it turned out, was quite profitable. There were always people willing to pay for the promise of a simpler world—a world of strong leaders and clear hierarchies, of national pride and racial purity, of order imposed by force.

The refugee crisis had been a gift. Every boat that landed on Italian shores, every terrorist attack blamed on Islamic extremists, every story of crime and disorder in immigrant neighborhoods—all of it drove people toward the organizations that promised to make things right again.

They had infiltrated the mainstream parties. Planted their ideas in the press. Built networks of supporters in the police, the military, the civil service.

They were closer to power than they had been in decades.

And if they got the treasure, they would be closer still.

That evening, Russo dined alone in his apartment—a simple meal of pasta and wine, eaten at the desk while he reviewed reports.

The genealogical investigation had already begun. Preliminary results were expected within the week. If the man's family had a connection to the war, they would know soon enough.

The surveillance team had confirmed the GPS tracker was in place. The Porsche was now visible on a map in real time—currently parked in a garage in Copenhagen, a blinking dot that represented two hundred and fifty million euros waiting to be claimed.

Everything was proceeding according to plan.

Russo finished his wine and went to bed.

He dreamed of diamonds.
