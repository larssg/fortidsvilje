# Style Guide & Writing Conventions

## Narrative Voice

### Point of View
- **Third person limited**
- POV shifts between chapters (not within)
- Primary POVs: Ole (present), Jens (past), occasionally antagonists

### Tense
- **Past tense** throughout
- Present tense only in dialogue

### Tone
- **Thriller pacing** with literary sensibility
- Spare, economical prose
- Short sentences for tension, longer for reflection
- Minimal exposition dumps

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Chapter Headers
```
CHAPTER [NUMBER]

[LOCATION, COUNTRY]
[Month/Date] [Year]
```

Example:
```
CHAPTER 14

DONGO, ITALY
July 2019
```

### Scene Breaks
- Indicated by blank line followed by new scene
- No asterisks or other dividers in revised version
- Significant time/location jumps get new scenes

### Dialogue
- Standard quotation marks: "dialogue"
- New paragraph for each speaker
- Minimal dialogue tags (said, asked preferred)
- Action beats replace tags where possible

### Internal Monologue
- Integrated into narrative, not italicized
- "He wondered if..." rather than *Did she know?*

## Recurring Motifs

### Light and Diamonds
- Diamonds "catch light and throw it back"
- "Frozen fire," "fragments," "cold and brilliant"
- Light reveals truth/treasure

### Waiting/Patience
- Chest "waiting" in darkness
- Organization "waiting" 75 years
- Jens "waiting" for right moment

### Promises
- "I gave my word" (repeated)
- Paul's dying request
- Moral weight of commitment

- "How little he'd known"

---

## Action Sequences

### Pacing Guidelines
- Short sentences
- Short paragraphs
- Sensory details (sounds, smells)
- Limited internal reflection during action
- Physical sensations emphasized

### Violence
- Direct but not gratuitous
- Consequences shown (Ole's reaction after killing)
- Physical reality (recoil, noise, blood)

Example:
```
Ole fired first.

The shot caught the street sweeper in the throat. He went down thrashing,
fingers scrabbling at the wound, blood spraying across the wooden floor.
```

---

## Emotional Beats

### Ole's Transformation
1. Bored, disconnected (Ch. 1)
2. Intrigued, awakening (Ch. 3)
3. Committed, nervous (Ch. 8)
4. Competent, alert (Ch. 17-18)
5. Deadly when necessary (Ch. 28)
6. Changed, reflective (Ch. 29)

### Handling Trauma
- Don't rush past emotional moments
- Physical symptoms (shaking hands, nausea)
- Dialogue that acknowledges weight
- "Does it get easier?"

---

## World-Building Details

### The Organization
- Never given explicit name
- "The movement," "we," "the organization"
- Neo-fascist, Mussolini loyalists
- Well-funded but aging
- Network of informants, not large active force

### Danish Society
- Teachers respected profession
- Summer houses in forest common
- Train travel between cities
- Understated wealth displays

### Italy (Lake Como)
- Tourist season in summer
- Small towns quiet, depopulated
- Mountain terrain challenging
- Beautiful but can be menacing

---

## Common Errors to Avoid

### Character Names
- ❌ Helga (Jens's sister) → ✅ Lillian
- ❌ Paul's "mother and sister" → ✅ Paul's "niece Helga"
- ❌ Keys from locksmith → ✅ Keys from suitcase

### Timeline
- ❌ Lung cancer → ✅ Heart failure
- ❌ Surgery "next month" → ✅ Surgery "next week"
- ❌ Keys forgotten in pocket → ✅ Keys in suitcase

### Consistency
- Diamonds always "cold and brilliant"
- Chest always ~30 kg
- Two keys, always turned simultaneously
- 75 years since theft, 67 years since suitcase hidden

---

## Dialogue Guidelines

### Danish Characters
- Direct, understated
- Dry humor under stress
- Practical focus

### Italian Antagonists
- More formal, measured
- References to history/legacy
- "Movement" language

### Historical Scenes (1945)
- Terse, military efficiency
- German terms for authenticity
- Exhaustion underlies everything

---

## Description Priorities

### Settings
1. Atmosphere first
2. Key details that matter to plot
3. Sensory specifics (smell, sound, temperature)
4. Minimal furniture/layout unless relevant

### Characters (Physical)
- Ole: Minimal description (reader stand-in)
- Malene: Competent presence, cut hair, new lines around eyes
- Jens: Young in photos, blond, smiling; hollow later
- Antagonists: Sharp eyes, age, calculation

### Objects
- Focus on weight, texture, condition
- Historical objects show their age
- Treasure catches light, always
