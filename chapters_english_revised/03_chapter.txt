CHAPTER 3

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK
April 2019


The locksmith's shop was tucked between a dry cleaner and a kebab place, the kind of business you'd walk past a hundred times without noticing. A bell chimed when Ole pushed through the door, and a small elderly man emerged from the back room, wiping his hands on a rag.

"Help you?"

Ole set the suitcase on the counter. "I found this in my father's house. The locks are seized. I don't want to destroy them if I can help it."

The locksmith studied the latches with professional interest, running a finger along the brass. "German. Prewar, I'd say. Good quality." He disappeared into the back and returned with a wire ring holding dozens of skeleton keys, each one numbered with a tiny metal tag.

It took him less than a minute. Key twenty-eight slid home, and both latches popped open with a satisfying click.

"Thirty kroner for the key," the old man said.

Ole paid, thanked him, and left without opening the suitcase. Something told him this wasn't meant for an audience.


Back in his apartment, he placed the suitcase on the dining table and stood there for a moment, hands flat on either side of it. His heart was beating faster than it should. Whatever was inside had been hidden for decades—hidden deliberately, in a crawl space no one knew existed.

He lifted the lid.

Brown paper, yellowed with age, covered the contents. Ole peeled it away and felt his breath catch.

An Iron Cross lay on top. First Class, from the look of it—the kind they pinned on soldiers who'd done something worth remembering. Or worth forgetting.

Next to it: a pistol.

Ole recognized the shape from war movies—a Walther P38, the standard German officer's sidearm. It was wrapped in oil-soaked paper that had preserved the metal perfectly. When he unwrapped it, the gun gleamed as if it had been cleaned yesterday.

Two magazines lay beside it. Both full. The brass casings of the cartridges glinted in the afternoon light.

Ole had never held a weapon in his life. Now he lifted the Walther carefully, feeling its weight, the cold precision of it. A functional killing machine, hidden in his childhood home for seventy-five years.

He set it down very carefully and walked to the bar cabinet. His hands were shaking as he poured himself a whiskey. He drank it in two swallows and poured another.

Under the pistol and the medal lay fabric—gray-green wool that crumbled at the edges when he touched it. He lifted it out and spread it on the table: a uniform jacket. The collar bore the distinctive double lightning bolt runes of the Schutzstaffel.

SS.

Ole sat down heavily and stared at the jacket. Someone in his family had worn this. Someone had hidden it away, along with a loaded pistol and an Iron Cross, in a secret compartment that even his father might not have known about.

The trousers were underneath, same fabric, same state of decay. He laid them beside the jacket—a ghost of a uniform, empty now but still somehow menacing.

At the bottom of the suitcase: a small book, an envelope, and a cloth pouch.

The book's cover read SOLDBUCH—a German soldier's identification and service record. Ole opened it with trembling fingers.

A young man stared back at him from the photograph inside. Early twenties, blond, smiling. He wore an SS uniform identical to the one on the table. There was something familiar about the face, something Ole couldn't quite place.

The name was printed clearly: JENS RABEN.

Ole's grandmother's maiden name had been Raben.

He flipped through the pages. Height, weight, hair color, blood type. Duty stations. Two hospitalizations—field hospitals in Kiel and Soltau. The 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS.

His grandmother's brother. It had to be. An uncle he'd never known existed.

No wonder no one had talked about him.


The envelope was unsealed. Inside: two small brass keys and several handwritten pages, the ink faded but still legible.


Odense, September 1952

My name is Jens Raben. I am the brother of Lillian Raben, now Henriksen. If you are reading this letter, I am almost certainly dead.

I am facing major heart surgery next week. The doctors say there is a one-in-three chance I will not survive. It is my intention to retrieve this suitcase afterward, but if the operation has gone wrong, you are now holding my final confession.

I hope you are family and not merely a stranger who has purchased the house.

The two keys in this envelope open a chest that I stole from Benito Mussolini shortly before his execution. How I managed it is a long story, and not one I will tell here.

The chest contains an almost unimaginable fortune in gemstones—no gold, no precious metals, only stones. I estimate approximately eight kilograms, the vast majority of which are diamonds. The chest itself weighs roughly twenty-five kilograms; if you attempt to move it any distance, you will slow yourself down and attract attention. Empty the jewels into bags or containers before transporting them.

I am aware that I face a lengthy prison sentence for having fought on the German side—even though the government encouraged us to enlist in the fight against Communism. I have already spent years in a prison camp. I will not go to prison again. I am therefore living in Germany, where I am safe from the Danish authorities.

Half of the valuables in the chest belong to my comrade Paul Fleischer, who died in the last days of the war. You must ensure that Paul's family receives their share. I gave him my word. Paul's family lives in Koblenz, on Florinspfaffengasse—his niece Helga should still be there. Paul and I served together in the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS; you may be able to use that as a lead.

You should know that many people are searching for this chest. I am the only one who knows its location.

To find it: travel to Lake Como in Italy. Find a town called Dongo on the western shore. From there, go up into the mountains to a small village called Garzeno. When you stand in the town square, you will see to the east a stone house sitting alone on a hilltop, approximately one kilometer away.

Go to the house. Stand at the north corner. Walk due north. After about fifty meters, you will find a flat, almost circular stone. Remove the stone and dig. You will find the chest.

Many people have searched for this treasure. Be careful not to attract attention. If many years have passed since the war, the danger may have diminished—but be cautious regardless. The fortune is too large to be forgotten.

Fortunately, no one knows my name or that I was present on Mussolini's final journey. You should be safe in Denmark.

If you need a helper, find someone of the opposite sex. You will make a convincing couple on a hiking holiday in the mountains—tourists enjoying the beautiful landscape west of Lake Como.

As proof that I am not lying, you will find several diamonds hidden in the cloth pouch at the bottom of the suitcase. Have them appraised. You will see they are worth a great deal.

What you do with the valuables, I cannot control. But ensure that Paul's family receives their share.

I gave my word.


Ole read the letter three times. His hands had stopped shaking, replaced by a strange numbness.

He opened the cloth pouch. Three diamonds caught the light and threw it back in fragments, cold and brilliant and utterly real.

Ole sat very still for a long time.


The next morning, he found a jeweler on Østerbrogade who advertised gemstone appraisal. The shop windows were full of watches and gold chains, the kind of place that bought old jewelry and asked few questions.

A well-dressed woman in her fifties emerged from behind the counter. "What can I do for you?"

"I have some diamonds I'd like appraised."

"My specialty."

Ole took the envelope from his pocket and poured the three stones onto the velvet display pad. The woman produced a loupe and a digital scale from a drawer.

She worked in silence, weighing each stone, examining it through the loupe, turning it to catch the light from different angles. When she was finished, she placed the diamonds back in the envelope and handed it to Ole.

"These are exceptional stones. Perfect clarity, excellent cut. If you wanted to sell them to me today, I could offer a hundred thousand kroner. At auction, depending on the market, perhaps more."

Ole felt the room tilt slightly. "A hundred thousand."

"For the three. Yes."

He thanked her and left, walking without seeing, his mind racing through calculations he couldn't complete. If three diamonds were worth a hundred thousand kroner, and the chest contained eight kilograms of similar stones...

The numbers were too large. They refused to become real.


Back in his apartment, he sat at the table and forced himself to think clearly.

He couldn't do this alone. The logistics were impossible—traveling to Italy, finding the location, digging up the chest, transporting the contents, finding Paul Fleischer's family. And that was before considering the legal complications. The jewels had been stolen. They probably belonged to the Italian state, or to Mussolini's heirs, or to someone else who had spent seventy-five years looking for them.

He needed help. Someone smart, someone discreet, someone who wouldn't be tempted to take everything for themselves.

His friends from the university were out—academics, all of them, more comfortable with books than adventures. They'd want to publish papers, consult lawyers, do everything by the proper channels.

Then he thought of Malene.

Malene Mouritzen. They'd been colleagues at Metropolitanskolen for three years, until she'd transferred to another school. They'd dated for a while—nothing serious, no dramatic ending, just a gradual fade as their schedules diverged and their enthusiasm waned.

She was a historian. Her thesis had been about Germany and Italy during World War II. She was smart, practical, and not easily shocked.

And she knew how to keep a secret.

He found her number and stared at it for a long moment. Calling an ex-girlfriend out of nowhere to propose a treasure hunt. It sounded insane even in his own head.

He called anyway.

"This is Malene."

"Hi. It's Ole."

A pause. Then: "Ole. It's been what, two years? Three?"

"Something like that. Listen, I know this is going to sound strange—"

"You need something."

"I need your help. But I can't explain on the phone. You'd have to see it to believe it."

"See what?"

"I found something. In my father's house. Something from the war."

Silence. He could almost hear her weighing the options.

"This isn't some desperate attempt to reconnect, is it? Because I'm really busy with exam prep right now."

"It's not that. I promise. This is... Malene, I found a treasure map. A real one. With diamonds."

More silence. Then a sharp laugh. "You're going to have to do better than that."

"Give me your number. I'll send you a photo."

He laid the three diamonds on the table, arranged them in a triangle, and took the picture. Sent it. Waited.

"What am I looking at?" Her voice had changed.

"Three diamonds from a suitcase I found hidden in my father's crawl space. The letter with them says there's a chest full of more, buried in the Italian Alps."

"That's... that can't be real."

"Meet me at Cafe Django. One hour. I'll bring everything."

Another pause. "This better not be bullshit, Ole."

"It's not."


Cafe Django hadn't changed. Same mismatched chairs, same chalkboard menu, same smell of coffee and frying onions. Ole took a corner table where they wouldn't be overheard and waited.

Malene walked in exactly on time. She'd cut her hair shorter since he'd last seen her, and there were new lines around her eyes, but she moved with the same restless energy he remembered.

She sat down across from him and said, "Show me."

Ole had printed photos of everything—the suitcase, the uniform, the pistol, the Soldbuch, a blurred image of the letter. He slid them across the table one by one, watching her face as she studied each image.

"Start from the beginning," she said.

He told her. His father's death, the funeral, the hidden door, the suitcase in the crawl space. The locksmith. The diamonds. The letter.

When he finished, Malene was silent for a long moment.

"The uniform is genuine," she said finally. "So is the Soldbuch. I've seen enough of them to know. And the pistol—that's a Walther P38, standard SS officer issue."

"And the letter?"

"The 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division was in northern Italy at the end of the war. They were basically destroyed—constant fighting, partisan attacks, Allied bombing. Very few survived." She tapped the photo of the Soldbuch. "Your grandmother's brother was one of them, apparently."

"So it could be true. The treasure."

"It could be." She met his eyes. "But I'd need to see the actual letter. The full text, not this blurred photo."

"At my apartment. I didn't want to bring it out."

She nodded slowly. "Then let's go."


In his apartment, Malene read the letter twice, holding the pages carefully by the edges. Then she set them down and began examining the other items—the uniform, the medals, the Soldbuch.

When she picked up the Walther, Ole tensed. But she handled it with easy familiarity, ejecting the magazine, checking the chamber, working the slide.

"My father collects these," she said, noticing his expression. "He has one exactly like it. I've handled weapons before."

"Can it still fire?"

"After a proper cleaning? Probably." She set the pistol down. "We should keep it."

"Keep it? Malene, if the police find a loaded weapon in my apartment—"

"They won't. And we might need it."

"Need it for what?"

She looked at him steadily. "You read the letter. There are people looking for this treasure. People who've been looking for seventy-five years. If we find it, we might not be the only ones who know."

Ole hadn't thought about that. He'd been too focused on the diamonds, the logistics, the impossibility of it all.

"I'm going home," Malene said. "It's late, and I need to think. But I'll be back tomorrow morning. Early." She paused at the door. "Don't do anything stupid before then."

After she left, Ole packed everything back into the suitcase and tried to watch television. It didn't work. His mind kept circling back to the letter, the diamonds, the dead man in the photograph who shared his grandmother's name.

He went to bed early but didn't sleep for hours.


The doorbell rang at eight the next morning. Ole stumbled to the intercom in his boxers.

"I brought pastries," Malene said. "Put coffee on."

By the time she reached his apartment, he'd started the coffee maker and pulled on clothes. Malene was already at the table, unpacking croissants and laying out the contents of the suitcase.

"I did some research last night," she said. "Mussolini was captured by partisans in Dongo—the same town mentioned in the letter. He was executed the next day, along with his mistress and several others."

"What happened to his treasure?"

"That's the interesting part. There were rumors for years that he'd been carrying a fortune in jewels when he fled. Gold, diamonds, cash. Nobody ever found it. The theory was that the partisans stole it, or that it was hidden somewhere along the escape route. People have been searching for it ever since."

"So the letter fits the historical record."

"Perfectly." Malene poured coffee for both of them. "Your grandmother's brother and this Paul Fleischer—they must have stolen the chest in Dongo and fled into the mountains. Something happened. Fleischer died. Your uncle buried the treasure and somehow made it back to Denmark."

"And then died in surgery without ever going back for it."

"Sixty-seven years," Malene said. "That chest has been sitting in the ground for nearly seventy-five years, waiting for someone to dig it up."

They looked at each other across the table.

"Summer vacation," Ole said. "We have four weeks. That should be enough time."

"More than enough." Malene was already making notes on a pad. "We fly into Milan, rent a car, drive to Lake Como. Act like tourists. Hiking boots, backpacks, cameras. A couple on holiday."

"And the digging?"

"At night. We find the house, confirm the location, come back after dark. One of us digs while the other keeps watch."

"And if someone sees us?"

Malene's expression hardened. "Then we deal with it."

Ole thought about the pistol, cleaned and oiled, hidden in the suitcase.

"There's something else we need to discuss," he said. "Paul Fleischer's family. The letter says they're owed half."

"I know." Malene's jaw tightened. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. First we need to actually find the chest. Everything else is theoretical until then."

It wasn't an answer, but Ole let it go. She was right—there was no point arguing about how to divide treasure they didn't have yet.

"We should buy hiking gear this afternoon," he said. "Break in the boots before we leave. I need to get in better shape, too."

"You have two months." Malene smiled for the first time that morning. "That should be enough time to get you up a mountain without having a heart attack."

"Thanks for the confidence."

Her phone buzzed. She glanced at it and frowned.

"I have to go. Exam prep." She stood and gathered her things. "But this weekend, we plan properly. Maps, timelines, contingencies. We do this right, or we don't do it at all."

"Agreed."

She paused at the door. "One more thing. That pistol—you should learn how to use it."

"Malene—"

"I'm serious. If someone's been searching for this treasure for seventy-five years, they're not going to let a couple of Danish schoolteachers walk away with it."

She left before he could respond.

Ole sat at the table, surrounded by the relics of a dead man's war, and wondered what exactly he'd gotten himself into.


That afternoon, his phone rang. The number was unfamiliar—a landline, somewhere in Denmark.

"This is Ole Henriksen."

"Mr. Henriksen? Arne Brix, from Aarup Auto Salvage. I'm calling about your father's car."

Ole had no idea what the man was talking about. "My father's car?"

"The Porsche 911. He's had it stored here for two years. Winter storage, heated building. The lawyer gave me your number as next of kin."

Ole sat down slowly. "My father owned a Porsche?"

"A beauty, too. 1989 Carrera, silver. We just finished the annual service. She's ready to drive whenever you want to pick her up."

A Porsche. His father—the quiet jeweler who'd never shown interest in anything but his shop and his routines—had owned a sports car and kept it in storage on Funen without telling anyone.

"I'll come tomorrow," Ole heard himself say. "Afternoon, if that works."

"Perfect. Take the train to Aarup, give me a call when you arrive. I'll pick you up at the station."

After he hung up, Ole sat staring at the phone for a long time.

His father had owned a Porsche. His grandmother's brother had been an SS soldier who'd stolen Mussolini's diamonds. What else didn't he know about his own family?

He called Malene.

"Change of plans for tomorrow. We're going to Funen to pick up a car."

"What car?"

"Apparently my father had a Porsche 911 in storage. I just found out."

Silence. Then: "Your boring, quiet father had a secret Porsche."

"Apparently."

"Ole, your family is considerably more interesting than you ever let on."

"Tell me about it."

"I'll meet you at Central Station tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock, platform six."

"You don't have to come—"

"A Porsche 911, Ole. I'm coming." She laughed. "Besides, you haven't driven in years. Someone needs to make sure you don't wrap it around a tree on the way home."

After he hung up, Ole looked around his apartment. The suitcase sat on the table, full of secrets. A Porsche waited on Funen. A chest of diamonds lay buried in the Italian Alps.

Two weeks ago, he'd been a bored high school teacher with a predictable life and no real plans.

Now he wasn't sure what he was.
