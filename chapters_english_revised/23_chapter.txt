CHAPTER 23

ITALY
2019


The mountains held their secrets well.

For two days, Malene and Ole hiked the high trails above Dongo, climbing until the tourists vanished and the world narrowed to rock, sky, and the ancient paths worn by generations of shepherds. The Porsche would take them as far as the roads allowed, then they'd walk for hours, following animal trails through terrain that seemed untouched by the modern world.

On the second afternoon, they discovered a small church perched impossibly on a mountain peak—no road leading to it, no houses nearby, just weathered stone and a rusted iron fence surrounding a small courtyard.

"Who would build a church up here?" Malene asked, pushing open the gate.

"Shepherds, maybe. A place to pray when you're alone with your flock for months."

Inside, the chapel was simple: two rows of wooden pews, a plain altar, a small wooden crucifix. The silence was absolute—not the absence of sound but something deeper, something that seemed to require stillness in return.

They sat without speaking. The modern world felt very far away.

Finally, they stepped back outside and walked to the cliff edge, where a rusted railing separated them from a thousand-foot drop. Lake Como glittered far below, and Dongo was visible as a cluster of terracotta roofs hugging the shoreline.

"I can almost see our hotel," Ole said.

Malene didn't answer. She was staring east, toward the mountains where, seventy-four years ago, two young soldiers had buried a fortune in diamonds.

Somewhere up there, it was still waiting.


That evening, over dinner, they made their plan.

"Tomorrow we go to Garzeno," Malene said. "We find the square, look east, and try to identify the house Jens described."

"A lot can change in seventy years."

"Or nothing at all. These mountains don't exactly embrace progress."

Ole set down his wine glass. "If new houses have been built in those hills, we'll never find the right one."

"Then we'll eliminate the new ones and focus on what's left." Malene reached across the table and touched his hand. "We've come this far. Let's not assume failure before we've started."

"You're right." He turned his hand to hold hers. "And if we don't find it—"

"We will." Her eyes held certainty. "I can feel it."


The road to Garzeno climbed through a series of brutal hairpin turns, the concrete cracked and crumbling, the guardrails rusted through in places. They passed villages that seemed abandoned—shutters closed, streets empty, laundry the only sign of life.

Garzeno itself was hardly larger: a maze of narrow streets that finally opened onto a small triangular square dominated by a church and a single bar with plastic furniture out front.

"Center Bar," Malene read. "Not exactly imaginative."

They sat at a table with a broken chair and waited. After ten minutes, Ole went inside and found an elderly man dozing behind the counter. He managed to order two beers and communicate that they wanted to sit outside.

When the drinks arrived, Ole produced his compass.

"East," he said, pointing at two houses that formed the third side of the square. "But we can't see the mountains from here. Those buildings are blocking the view."

Malene studied the houses. One looked like a municipal office of some kind. "We need to get inside. Get to an upper floor with windows facing east."

"And our excuse?"

She smiled. "We're lost tourists who can't find the hiking trails. They'll fall over themselves to help."

The young man at the municipal office spoke excellent English and was eager to assist. He produced an old map—hand-drawn, worn at the folds—and began explaining routes into the mountains.

While Ole bent over the map, asking questions, Malene slipped into the man's office. Through the east-facing window, she could see the mountains clearly—ridge after ridge rising toward the peaks. She pulled out her phone and began photographing systematically, covering every angle.

The map was the real prize. Ole studied it while pretending to listen to the route descriptions. It was old—old enough to show the mountains as they'd looked during the war. Every house, every path, every landmark.

"May I photograph this?" he asked. "So we don't get lost?"

"Of course." The young man smiled, pleased to help.

Back in the car, they compared what they'd gathered.

"Your photos show the current terrain," Ole said. "The map shows how it looked in 1945. We cross-reference them, eliminate anything built after the war, and focus on what's left."

"And if the house is gone?"

"Then we look for its foundation."


They drove to Como that afternoon and bought two iPads—large screens for comparing images side by side. Back at the hotel, they spread their evidence across the bed.

The work was methodical. Photo by photo, they matched Malene's images to the old map, marking houses that appeared in both, noting structures that existed only on the map, eliminating modern construction.

"Three possibilities," Ole said finally. "Three houses that were there in 1945 and match what Jens described—east of the square, visible from a hilltop."

Malene studied the map. "Two, actually. This one"—she pointed—"is too far up. Jens couldn't have carried the chest that distance alone. And this one appears to be in a valley, not on a hilltop."

"Which leaves this one."

They both stared at the spot on the map. A single house, high in the mountains, marked with a small square that no longer appeared in any of Malene's photographs.

"The house is gone," Ole said. "But the foundation might still be there."

"Then tomorrow, we find it."


From a beach bar along the promenade, Russo watched them return to the hotel, iPads in hand.

He smiled and raised his Campari in a private toast.

Whatever they'd found in Como, it had clearly advanced their search. The GPS tracker had shown them driving to Garzeno, lingering in the village square, then heading south to purchase electronics.

Now they had tools. Now they were getting serious.

He checked his phone. The waiter and street sweeper were ready—transport arranged, surveillance positions identified, the safe house prepared.

Russo finished his drink and signaled for another.

The trap was set.

All that remained was waiting for the prey to walk in.
