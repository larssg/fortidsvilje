CHAPTER 1

ODENSE, DENMARK
April 2019


The phone alarm dragged Ole from a dreamless sleep. For a moment he didn't know where he was—the ceiling was wrong, the light came from the wrong angle, the mattress was too soft. Then it clicked: his childhood bedroom. His father's house. The house that was now, technically, his.

He swung his legs over the side of the bed and sat there, running a hand through his hair. Forty-two years old and he still felt like an intruder in these rooms.

Downstairs, he made coffee in his father's ancient percolator. The machine wheezed and gurgled like it was on its last legs. Everything in this house felt that way—tired, worn out, waiting to be put out of its misery.

His father had collapsed four days ago. Heart attack, mid-stride, on his usual walk through the neighborhood. Dead before he hit the pavement, the paramedics said. As if that was supposed to be a comfort.

Ole had two real estate agents coming this morning. Then the funeral. Then the long process of sorting through forty years of accumulated belongings before the Salvation Army hauled it all away.

He walked through the living room, coffee in hand, and tried to feel something. Grief, maybe. Or nostalgia. Instead, there was only the low hum of disconnection he'd felt since the day his mother died—twenty-eight years ago now, cancer, three months from diagnosis to funeral. He'd been fourteen. His father had retreated into his jewelry shop like it was a bunker, leaving Ole to fend for himself with a rotating cast of housekeepers who never stayed long.

They'd grown apart. That was the polite way to put it. The truth was simpler: they'd never been together in the first place.

Ole had left for Copenhagen the week after his high school graduation and never looked back. The visits home grew shorter and further apart until they became obligations rather than desires—Christmas every few years, an occasional birthday. His father never complained, which somehow made it worse.

Now here he was, back in Odense, preparing to sell off the last physical evidence that the man had ever existed.


The real estate agents arrived within minutes of each other—a coincidence that forced an awkward three-way conversation in the front hall. Both wore expensive suits and easy smiles. Both praised the house's "character" and "potential" before launching into lists of everything that would need updating to meet modern buyers' expectations.

The house had been built by Ole's grandfather, who'd also founded the family jewelry business. Both had passed to Ole's father, and now both would pass to Ole—though he had no interest in running a shop in a city he'd spent two decades avoiding.

He'd already decided to go with whichever agent quoted lower. He wanted this done quickly. Cleanly. The house was in a good neighborhood near the city center; it would sell.


The funeral was held in the local church at two o'clock. Ole sat in the front pew and counted the attendees without turning around: himself and two neighbors. That was it. The sum total of his father's social connections.

The pastor spoke for seven minutes. Generic words about a man he'd never met—comfort in faith, peace in passing, the usual. Ole had been asked to provide details about his father's life and had come up empty. What could he say? He liked watches. He kept the books balanced. He ate dinner alone for twenty-five years.

After the service, one of the neighbors caught him outside. Mrs. Henriksen, who'd lived next door since before Ole was born. Sharp eyes in a lined face.

"We haven't seen much of you these past years," she said.

"No." He shifted his weight. "I suppose not."

"Your father mentioned it sometimes. That you didn't visit."

Ole felt heat creep up his neck. He was forty-two years old, a respected teacher at one of Copenhagen's best schools, and this elderly woman was making him feel like a guilty child.

"It's not that far, Copenhagen," she continued. "Just a couple hours on the train."

"I should go," Ole said. "There's a lot to sort through."

He walked away before she could respond.


Back at the house, he found two beers in the refrigerator and drank them both at the kitchen table. The afternoon light stretched across the floor, and he let his mind wander to the inheritance. The house would fetch a decent price. The shop had been sold years ago when his father retired. There might be savings, investments—his father had always been careful with money.

What would he do with it? He didn't need anything. He had his job at Metropolitanskolen, his apartment in Østerbro, his comfortable routines. A boat, maybe. A summer house somewhere quiet.

Luxury problems.

He fell asleep on the living room sofa, still in his funeral suit, and dreamed of nothing.


When he woke, the light had shifted to evening gold. He felt restless, cooped up. Instead of starting the cleanup, he decided to walk.

The neighborhood unfolded around him like a half-forgotten memory. The same streets, the same houses, everything smaller than he remembered. The corner store where he'd bought candy was now a private residence. The newsstand was a coffee shop.

He passed his old elementary school and could still name every classroom, every teacher who'd occupied them. Then the high school, where he'd first discovered his talent for mathematics and physics—the foundation of his entire career.

Ten years now at Metropolitanskolen. He was good at it, or at least competent. The job had become routine, the lessons practically teaching themselves. Lately he'd found himself wondering if there was something else. Something more. But the wondering never turned into action. He had it too good to risk change.


He got back to the house as dusk settled over the neighborhood. Two hours of walking had cleared his head. He worked through the upstairs rooms systematically, filling garbage bags and stacking papers for shredding.

His father, it turned out, had been organized. All the important documents—birth certificates, bank statements, insurance policies—were filed neatly in a roll-top desk in the study. The job Ole had dreaded would take a fraction of the time he'd expected.

Dinner was pizza delivery and a bottle of wine from his father's modest collection. He watched half a movie on television, finished the bottle, and went to bed.


The next morning, he attacked the remaining rooms with renewed energy. By noon, he was nearly done. One room left: the guest room under the eaves, though it had never hosted a guest in Ole's memory. It served as storage for things without a proper home—old lamps, boxes of photographs, his grandmother's china.

Against the knee wall stood a low bookcase, sagging under the weight of Salmonsen's Encyclopedia—twenty-six volumes of densely packed knowledge from an era before the internet made such things obsolete.

The bookcase was tilted. One corner leg had buckled under decades of strain.

Ole pulled the volumes onto the floor, grunting at their weight. When he dragged the empty case away from the wall, he saw something that made him stop.

A small door. Set into the knee wall. Hidden for years behind the bookcase.

He stared at it for a long moment. Twenty years he'd lived in this house, and he'd never known this door existed.

The handle was cold under his palm. The door swung inward on silent hinges, revealing a crawl space that stretched into darkness beneath the eaves. Cold air seeped out, carrying the smell of old wood and dust.

Nothing in there. Just shadows.

He fixed the bookcase leg with a few well-placed shims and went back downstairs. Tomorrow he'd return to Copenhagen, to his real life. This house and its memories would belong to someone else soon enough.


That night, the wind rose.

Ole woke to a rhythmic banging—the crawl space door, caught by the draft, slamming against its frame. He stumbled upstairs in the dark and wedged two encyclopedia volumes against it to hold it shut.

Standing there in his boxers, shivering in the cold air that leaked around the door's edges, he felt a strange unease. All those years. All those times he'd played in this room as a child, slept in this house as a teenager. And he'd never known.

Had his father known?


In the morning, curiosity got the better of him.

If the wind could blow in that strongly, there might be a leak in the roof. Water damage. Something that would need to be disclosed to buyers.

He found a flashlight in the kitchen and returned to the guest room. This time, when he opened the crawl space door, he shone the light into the darkness.

No leaks that he could see. The roof boards were intact, the insulation undisturbed. But at the far end of the crawl space, maybe two meters in, something else caught the light.

A suitcase.

Small, leather, covered in the gray-green patina of age. It looked like something from another era. His grandfather's generation, maybe. Earlier.

The opening was too small for him to fit through. He tried reaching, but the case was just beyond his fingertips.

In the back hallway closet, he found an old broom. He carried it upstairs, thrust the handle into the crawl space, and hooked the bristle end through the suitcase's leather strap. Slowly, carefully, he dragged it toward him until he could grab the handle with his hand.

The leather was cold and slightly damp. But intact. Whatever this was, it had survived decades in the darkness.

He tried the latches. Locked. Both of them, seized tight.

Ole checked his watch. If he was going to make his train, he needed to leave now.

He wiped the worst of the grime off the suitcase with a damp towel, stuffed it into his backpack alongside his own belongings, and called a taxi.


Two hours later, he was home.

His apartment in Østerbro wrapped around him like a familiar embrace. The right ceiling, the right light, the right mattress. He made a cup of tea and sank into his usual chair.

The suitcase sat in the entryway, silent but somehow insistent. Like it was waiting for him to decide what to do with it.

He tried the locks again. No luck. Tweezers, screwdriver, butter knife—nothing worked. The mechanisms were precision-made, built to resist exactly this kind of amateur assault.

He could smash them open with a hammer. But something stopped him. The suitcase had survived this long. It deserved better than brute force.

He remembered a locksmith on Østerbrogade. He'd used them once, years ago, when he'd locked himself out. They'd seemed professional. Discreet.

Ole grabbed the suitcase and headed out into the evening.

Whatever was inside, he was about to find out.
