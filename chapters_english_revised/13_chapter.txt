CHAPTER 13

NORTHERN ITALY
May 1945


The warehouse gates opened at dawn.

Guards set up tables with bread, cheese, and water. The prisoners lined up in something resembling military order—old habits dying hard even now—and received their rations. Then they were formed into columns and marched out along the railway tracks.

The trains were waiting at a loading ramp. Three cattle cars and a passenger car, a small locomotive already building steam. The Germans were divided into groups and herded into the cars, twenty men to each, and the doors were bolted shut behind them.

Inside, straw had been scattered on the floor. A bucket of water stood in one corner, a latrine bucket in the other. Luxury, by the standards Jens had become accustomed to.

He'd seen Russian prisoners transported in cars like these—fifty men crammed into spaces meant for cattle, no water, no sanitation, corpses stacked like cordwood when they finally arrived. He'd heard about the Jewish transports, packed so tight that people died standing up, crushed by the weight of bodies around them.

This was different. Almost humane.

The train lurched into motion, and the Italian countryside began to slide past the gaps in the wooden walls.


Heinrich, the big soldier from the march, had ended up in the same car. They found a space against the wall and sat together, watching the landscape through a crack in the boards.

"South," Heinrich said. "Milan, probably. That's where they're gathering everyone."

"And then?"

"A camp. What else?"

They sat in silence for a while. The train swayed and rattled, the rhythm almost hypnotic.

"Where are you from?" Jens asked.

"Volkmarsen. Small town in Hesse." Heinrich's face softened at the mention of home. "My father owns the butcher shop. I'm supposed to take over someday."

"You have family there?"

"Parents, two sisters, half the town." He smiled. "Everyone knows everyone. It's that kind of place."

Jens thought about Odense. His sister Lillian, who wanted nothing to do with him. His parents' graves, untended for years. The empty spaces where connections should have been.

"What about you?" Heinrich asked. "Anyone waiting in Denmark?"

"No one."

Heinrich studied him for a moment. "When this is over—if you don't want to go back—come find me in Volkmarsen. I can get you work. A place to stay."

"You don't know me."

"I know enough." Heinrich shrugged. "You're a decent man. You kept your head when things got bad. That's more than I can say for most."

Jens didn't know how to respond. Kindness had become so foreign to him that he barely recognized it anymore.

"Thank you," he said finally. "I might take you up on that."


The train stopped at a large marshaling yard outside Milan. More warehouses, more ramps, more prisoners being sorted and processed.

The Americans had a system. Regular Wehrmacht soldiers were separated from the SS, documented, and prepared for release. The SS men were held back for further investigation.

Jens watched from a corner of the warehouse as the separation proceeded. An officer called names from a list. Soldiers stepped forward, showed their left forearms, handed over their Soldbücher. Those with the distinctive SS blood-type tattoo were directed to one side. Those without were sent toward the gates—toward freedom, toward home.

When Heinrich's name was called, he turned and caught Jens's eye. "Remember—Volkmarsen. The butcher shop. I'll be there."

"I'll remember."

Then Heinrich was gone, walking out through the gates into the Italian sunshine, and Jens was alone among the damned.


An American officer addressed the remaining prisoners in broken German. The war in Italy was over. Wehrmacht soldiers were being released. SS men would be transferred to a camp at Rimini for further processing.

"Processing" meant investigation. They would dig into service records, try to identify who had participated in which atrocities. The concentration camp guards. The massacre perpetrators. The war criminals.

Jens had never served in the camps. He'd never been present at the organized massacres in Italy. But the things he'd done in the East—the burning villages, the mass graves, the casual murders that had become routine—those would be enough to hang him if anyone looked closely enough.

He told himself it wouldn't come to that. There were thousands of SS men to process. They couldn't investigate everyone thoroughly. He would keep his head down, say nothing, and hope to slip through the cracks.

It was the only plan he had.


They loaded onto another train that afternoon. This one headed east, toward the Adriatic coast, toward Rimini and the camp that waited there.

Jens found a spot against the wall and closed his eyes. He thought about the chest, buried in the mountains above Lake Como. The flat stone. The north corner of the house. Fifty meters due north.

Someday he would go back. Someday he would dig it up and start a new life somewhere far away. But not yet. Not for years, maybe.

First he had to survive the camp.

First he had to survive whatever came next.


The train rattled through the Italian night, carrying its cargo of defeated men toward an uncertain future. Jens slept fitfully, dreaming of diamonds and blood and a face he was already beginning to forget—Paul Fleischer, dying in the driver's seat, making him promise.

Find my niece Helga. Give her family their share.

I swear.

When he woke, the sun was rising over the Adriatic, and the towers of Rimini were visible in the distance.

The camp was waiting.
