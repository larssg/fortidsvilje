CHAPTER 24

ITALY
2019


Russo stood on his balcony, cigarette smoke curling into the morning air, watching the red dot pulse on his tablet screen.

The Danes were moving.

Not the aimless wandering of the past few days—the random hikes, the tourist photography, the long lunches in mountain villages. This was different. Purposeful. They'd bypassed Garzeno entirely and were climbing higher into the mountains, following the narrow road that wound toward the peaks.

The dot stopped.

Russo's pulse quickened. He zoomed in on the map, noting the location—a hairpin turn above a farm, deep in the mountains where the roads turned to gravel and the guardrails gave way to nothing.

This was it.

He grabbed his phone and called the waiter. "Move. Now. They've stopped near the coordinates I'm sending you."

"We're ready."

"Drive past their position and find cover higher up. Approach on foot. I want eyes on them without being seen."

"Understood."

"And remember—do nothing until they've found it. I don't care if it takes hours. Let them do the work."

Russo killed the call and returned to the screen. The red dot remained stationary. Somewhere up there, the Danes were searching.

He lit another cigarette and settled in to wait.


The old Fiat climbed through the mountains, the waiter behind the wheel, the street sweeper riding shotgun. Both wore clothes scavenged from the hotel's lost-and-found bin—faded work clothes, caps pulled low. Nothing memorable.

They found the Porsche parked in a narrow pullout, half-hidden by scrub brush. The waiter continued past without slowing, following the road another kilometer before finding a spot to conceal the Fiat behind a crumbling stone wall.

The descent took twenty minutes, picking their way through dense brush, following the sound of voices until they could see the Danes in a small clearing below.

The street sweeper pressed a finger to his lips. They settled into position behind a fallen tree, screened by bushes, watching.


Below them, the Danes were digging.

Not for the treasure—not yet. They were excavating something else, using a spade to cut through tangled roots and compacted soil. Methodical work, the woman and man taking turns while sweat darkened their shirts.

"They're looking for a foundation," the waiter whispered. "The old house."

They watched for two hours as the Danes expanded their trench, following a line of stones buried beneath decades of growth. Finally, the man stepped back and wiped his face.

"That's enough," they heard him say. "We've found the corner. Tomorrow we measure from here."

The Danes gathered their tools and began the trek back to their car.

The waiter and street sweeper waited until the Porsche's engine faded down the mountain before approaching the excavation. They found exactly what the waiter had described—the remnants of a foundation, partially exposed, stones arranged in a clear rectangular pattern.

The street sweeper grinned. "They're close."

"Tomorrow they'll lead us right to it."


Back at the hotel, Russo listened to the waiter's report with barely contained excitement.

"A foundation," he repeated. "They spent all day finding a foundation."

"It's how they're navigating. The instructions must reference the old house as a starting point."

"And tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow they'll measure from the foundation to wherever the treasure is buried. We'll be in position before they arrive."

Russo nodded slowly. "Contact the cleaning team. Tell them to be ready to move within forty-eight hours."

"You're certain we'll have the treasure by then?"

"The Danes are doing all the work." Russo smiled. "All we have to do is take it from them."

The waiter hesitated. "And the Danes themselves?"

"What about them?"

"After we have the treasure. What happens to them?"

Russo's smile didn't waver. "They disappear. Along with anyone who could connect us to this operation."

The waiter's expression flickered—something that might have been unease—but he nodded. "I'll make the calls."

After he left, Russo returned to his balcony. The lake was golden in the evening light, tourists strolling the promenade, boats cutting white wakes across the water.

Such a beautiful place for people to die.

He'd killed before—many times, in service to the cause. The Danes would simply be two more names on a list that stretched back decades. Their deaths meant nothing against the greater purpose.

And once the treasure was his, once he returned to Rome with Mussolini's diamonds, his position would be unassailable. He would be the man who'd succeeded where generations had failed.

The man who'd made the dream possible again.

Russo lit a cigarette and watched the sun sink toward the mountains.

Tomorrow, or the day after.

Patience.
