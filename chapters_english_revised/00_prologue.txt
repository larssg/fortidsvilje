KOBLENZ, GERMANY
2019


The morning news droned from the small television in the corner, but Helga Jantzen wasn't listening. At seventy-three, she had earned the right to take her time. She cradled her coffee cup in both hands, savoring the warmth, watching dust motes drift through the slant of spring sunlight that fell across her kitchen table.

The apartment was quiet. It had been quiet for six years now, ever since Werner's heart gave out. The children called on Sundays, sometimes. They had their own lives, their own problems. She understood.

Her pension wasn't much, but she'd learned to stretch a euro. There was something satisfying about that—about needing so little, about watching the harried residents of her building rush off to obligations she no longer had to meet.

The doorbell shattered the silence.

Helga froze, cup halfway to her lips. She ran through her mental calendar. No appointments. No visitors expected. The building super would have called first. So would her daughter.

She set down the cup and moved toward the door, her slippers whispering against the linoleum. Through the peephole, she saw a postal carrier—young, bored, already glancing at his watch.

"Package for Jantzen," he said when she opened the door. "Signature required."

She signed. He left. And Helga found herself holding a small parcel wrapped in heavy brown paper and wound several times with twine. Old-fashioned packaging. The kind people used decades ago.

The return address made her pause.

Denmark.

She didn't know anyone in Denmark. Had never been there, never had reason to go. Perhaps one of the children had ordered something online—that was what young people did these days, wasn't it? She'd just had her birthday. A belated gift, perhaps.

Back at the kitchen table, she needed scissors for the twine, which had been knotted with almost obsessive care. Beneath the paper: a shoebox. Worn, ordinary. She lifted the lid and found crumpled newspaper surrounding yet another box, also wrapped and tied.

Her hands trembled slightly as she cut through the second layer. Not from age—from something else. A premonition, perhaps. The sense that whatever was inside this box had traveled a very long way to reach her.

Inside the smaller box: a cloth pouch, heavy for its size, and a single sheet of paper folded in thirds.

She unfolded the letter and read:


Dear Mrs. Jantzen,

I am sending you this package because your uncle Paul, during the war, shortly before his death, participated in certain events that entitled him to a share of a treasure consisting of first-class diamonds.

The treasure has now been found.

The pouch contains your uncle's share. When you have the stones appraised, you will discover that you are now a wealthy woman.

I hope this finds you in good health and wish you well in the years ahead.

With kind regards,
NN

P.S. Do not attempt to discover my identity. If you wish to keep the diamonds, absolute discretion is essential.


Helga read the letter twice. Three times. Then she set it down very carefully on the table and reached for the cloth pouch.

It was heavier than it looked.

She loosened the drawstring and poured the contents into her palm. A dozen stones caught the morning light—clear, brilliant, cold as ice and just as hard.

The news anchor on the television was talking about the weather. Partly cloudy, chance of rain.

Helga Jantzen sat alone in her kitchen, diamonds glittering in her shaking hand, and wondered what her uncle Paul had done during the war that she had never known about.

What any of them had done.
