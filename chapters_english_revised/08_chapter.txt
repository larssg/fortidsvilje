CHAPTER 8

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK
May 2019


The weeks passed in a blur of preparation.

Ole joined a gym near his apartment and began a routine of treadmill running and weight training. His body protested at first—muscles he'd forgotten existed screamed their objections—but gradually the pain faded into soreness, and the soreness into something like strength.

Three times a week, he met Malene in the Porsche garage on Heimdalsgade. She taught him to drive the car—first in empty parking lots, then on quiet roads, finally on the highways that radiated out from Copenhagen like spokes from a wheel.

The Porsche was unlike anything he'd ever driven. Alive in a way modern cars weren't. Every input through the steering wheel communicated directly to his hands; every press of the throttle produced an immediate, visceral response. He began to understand why his father had loved it.

"You're getting better," Malene said one evening, as Ole guided the car through a series of curves on a country road outside the city. "Still too tense, but better."

"I feel like the car is going to get away from me."

"It won't. These old Porsches are forgiving—as long as you respect them." She reached over and adjusted his grip on the wheel. "Lighter hands. Let the car tell you what it wants to do."

He tried. The steering wheel trembled in his fingers, communicating the texture of the road, the shift of weight as they rounded another curve. For just a moment, he felt what she meant—the car and driver working together, moving as one.

Then he overthought it, tensed up, and the feeling was gone.

"Progress," Malene said. "By July, you'll be ready."


The research consumed their evenings.

Malene had obtained detailed topographical maps of the Lake Como region—paper maps, bought from a specialty shop in the city center, paid for in cash. She'd also downloaded satellite imagery from multiple sources, using a VPN and a series of temporary accounts that couldn't be traced back to either of them.

"Paranoid?" Ole asked, watching her work.

"Careful. There's a difference."

They spread the maps across Ole's dining table and began the slow process of identifying potential locations. Garzeno was easy to find—a small village in the mountains above the lake, accessible by a winding road that zigzagged up from the shore. From the village square, the terrain rose steeply to the east.

"The letter says to look for a stone house on a hilltop," Malene said, tracing the contour lines with her finger. "Approximately one kilometer from the square, visible from the center of town."

"That could be anywhere."

"Not anywhere. It has to be on a hilltop—which means elevated terrain, relatively clear of trees. And it has to be visible from the square, which means line of sight."

She pulled up the satellite imagery on her laptop and began comparing it to the map. After an hour, she'd identified three possible locations—three spots where the terrain matched the description and where satellite photos showed what might be structures.

"We won't know for sure until we get there," she admitted. "The satellite images are too low-resolution to see individual houses clearly. But this gives us a starting point."

"And if none of them are right?"

"Then we search systematically. The chest is there, Ole. It's been there for seventy-five years. We just have to find it."


The pistol arrived in a package from a contact of Malene's father—a retired army officer who collected military antiques and didn't ask questions. It was a matching Walther P38, in better condition than the one from the suitcase, with a complete set of cleaning supplies and two additional magazines.

"Insurance," Malene said, hefting the weapon. "If the original doesn't work, we have a backup."

"I thought you were going to clean the original."

"I am. But seventy-five years is a long time. Even well-preserved weapons can fail." She set the pistol down and looked at him. "Have you ever fired a gun?"

"No."

"Then we need to fix that."

Two days later, she drove him to a shooting range outside Copenhagen—a private club where her father was a member, where questions weren't asked and cash was accepted. The range officer showed Ole the basics: stance, grip, sight alignment, trigger squeeze.

Then he handed him a .22 caliber target pistol and pointed him at a paper silhouette twenty meters away.

The first shot surprised him—the recoil, the noise, the sudden violence of it. His bullet went wide, missing the target entirely.

"Again," Malene said. "And breathe."

By the end of the session, he could put five out of ten shots in the center of the target. Not impressive by any standard, but better than nothing.

"We'll come back," Malene said. "Once a week until we leave."

Ole looked at the pistol in his hands—the weight of it, the deadly precision of its engineering—and felt something shift inside him.

He was really going to do this.

Whatever "this" turned out to be.


June arrived, and with it the end of the school year.

Ole submitted his grades, attended the requisite faculty meetings, and told everyone who asked that he was planning a hiking holiday in the Italian Alps. A few colleagues expressed surprise—Ole wasn't known for outdoor activities—but no one questioned it. Teachers traveled in summer. That was what teachers did.

Malene had a similar cover story at her school. Two weeks of vacation, starting in early July. She'd told her principal she was visiting friends in Switzerland.

"Not entirely a lie," she said. "We'll be in that general part of the world."

"Do you have friends in Switzerland?"

"I have acquaintances. People I could plausibly be visiting." She smiled. "The best lies are mostly true."

They finalized their plans over dinner at his apartment. Drive down through Germany, cross into Austria at Salzburg, continue through the Brenner Pass into Italy. Two days of driving, maybe three if they stopped to play tourist along the way.

"We arrive in Dongo on July 8th," Malene said, consulting her notes. "We've booked a room at Albergo Dongo for fourteen nights. That gives us two full weeks to find the chest, dig it up, and get out."

"And if we can't find it in two weeks?"

"Then we reassess. But we won't need two weeks. The location is specific. Either the house is there, or it isn't. Either the stone is where the letter says, or it isn't."

"And if someone else is looking?"

Malene's expression hardened. "That's what the pistols are for."

They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of it settling over them.

"This is really happening," Ole said. "In three weeks, we'll be in Italy, digging for buried treasure."

"In three weeks, we might be rich." Malene raised her wine glass. "Or we might be dead. Either way, we won't be bored."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's not meant to be." She clinked her glass against his. "To adventure."

"To adventure."

They drank.


The night before they left, Ole couldn't sleep.

He lay in the darkness of his apartment, staring at the ceiling, running through the plan in his mind. The route, the timing, the contingencies. The chest, the keys, the letter that had started everything.

His grandmother's brother. An SS soldier. A thief and a killer who'd buried a fortune in the Italian mountains and died before he could retrieve it.

And now Ole—boring, predictable, play-it-safe Ole—was going to finish what Jens Raben had started.

He thought about his father, alone in that house in Odense, driving his secret Porsche on summer weekends, keeping his dreams hidden from everyone.

Maybe it ran in the family. The hidden depths. The secret lives.

Maybe Ole was more like them than he'd ever realized.

He rolled onto his side and closed his eyes. Tomorrow they would begin. Whatever came next—treasure or disaster, wealth or death—he was ready.

Or as ready as he would ever be.
