They met at Central Station at ten, as agreed. Malene had a paper cup of coffee and a messenger bag slung across her chest; Ole had the nervous energy of a man who hadn't slept well.

"Platform six," she said. "Train leaves in twenty minutes."

They found seats in a quiet car and watched Copenhagen slide away through the window—apartment blocks, then suburbs, then the flat green expanse of Zealand farmland.

"I did more research last night," Malene said, keeping her voice low. "Mussolini was captured in Dongo on April 27, 1945. He was traveling in a German convoy, disguised in a Luftwaffe greatcoat. The partisans found him hiding in the back of a truck."

"What about the treasure?"

"That's where it gets interesting. According to the historical record, he was carrying two bags when he was captured. The partisans claimed they contained documents—official papers, correspondence with Hitler, that sort of thing. But the rumors have always said there was more. Gold, jewels, cash. A dictator's retirement fund."

"And no one ever found it."

"The bags disappeared. The partisans blamed each other. The Italian government launched investigations that went nowhere. Treasure hunters have been searching the area ever since." Malene sipped her coffee. "If your uncle's letter is accurate, everyone's been looking in the wrong place. The treasure was stolen before Mussolini was captured—in Dongo, at a restaurant, by two SS men who drove off into the mountains."

Ole thought about the photograph in the Soldbuch. The smiling young man in the SS uniform. His grandmother's brother.

"He mentions in the letter that there are people searching for the chest. That it might be dangerous."

"That was seventy-five years ago. Anyone who was actively searching then is either dead or very, very old." Malene shrugged. "We should still be careful, but I don't think we're going to run into competition."

"I hope you're right."

The train crossed the Great Belt Bridge, the water glittering below them in the morning sun. Ole watched the suspension cables sweep past and tried to imagine what it would feel like to hold a chest full of diamonds.

He couldn't.

Aarup was a small town, the kind of place you drove through on the way to somewhere else. They stepped off the train into bright sunshine and the smell of cut grass.

Ole called the number he'd been given. Ten minutes later, a battered pickup truck pulled into the station parking lot.

Arne Brix was a weathered man in his sixties, with grease-stained hands and an easy smile. He shook Ole's hand warmly and nodded at Malene.

"Good to meet you. Sorry about your father."

"Thank you."

"The car's ready. Just finished the service yesterday—oil change, brake fluid, the works. She's been sitting all winter, so I wanted to make sure everything was in order before you took her out."

They climbed into the pickup and drove through quiet streets lined with modest houses and carefully tended gardens. The auto salvage yard was on the outskirts of town, behind a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire.

"Not much to look at from the outside," Arne said, "but we've got a heated warehouse in back. That's where your father kept the Porsche."

"Can I ask—how long did he have the car here?"

"Two years now. He'd come out maybe once a month during the summer, take it for a drive around the island, have lunch somewhere nice. Then he'd bring it back and we wouldn't see him again until the next month." Arne shook his head. "He seemed like a man who enjoyed having something to look forward to."

Ole thought about his father—the quiet jeweler, the man who never talked about himself, who'd spent the last twenty-five years alone in a house full of silence.

A secret Porsche. A hidden crawl space. A brother-in-law who'd been an SS soldier.

How little he'd known.

The warehouse was immaculate—climate-controlled, with polished concrete floors and overhead lighting that made everything gleam. A dozen cars sat under dust covers, waiting for owners who would collect them when the weather turned warm.

Arne led them to the far corner and pulled back a canvas cover.

"1989 Carrera," he said. "One of the last air-cooled models. She's a classic."

The Porsche was silver, low-slung and aggressive, with the distinctive sloping rear that defined the 911 shape. Even sitting still, it looked fast.

Malene circled the car slowly, running her hand along the fender. "Beautiful."

"Your father bought it about three years ago. Said he'd always wanted one." Arne handed Ole a set of keys. "She's all yours now."

Ole looked at the keys in his hand. They felt heavier than they should.

"I haven't driven in years," he admitted.

Malene plucked the keys from his palm. "I have. Scoot over."

The Porsche came alive with a roar that vibrated through Ole's chest. The engine was behind them—he could feel the heat of it through the seat—and it sounded like nothing he'd ever heard. Raw, mechanical, hungry.

Malene eased them out of the warehouse and onto the access road. Her hands were relaxed on the wheel, her movements smooth and confident.

"The clutch is stiff," she said. "And the steering is heavier than a modern car. But God, listen to that engine."

They drove through Aarup and picked up the highway toward Odense, then Copenhagen. The car attracted stares at every traffic light—people craning their necks, pulling out phones to take pictures. Ole felt conspicuous in a way he'd never experienced before.

"We could take this to Italy," Malene said. "It's reliable enough for a road trip, and it would fit the cover story. A couple on a driving holiday, taking the scenic route through the Alps."

"Is that practical?"

"More practical than flying with a loaded Walther in our luggage." She glanced at him. "We need to think about how we're getting the chest out of Italy. If it's as heavy as the letter says, we can't exactly carry it onto a plane."

"Drive down, drive back?"

"That's what I'm thinking. It's two days each way, maybe three if we take it slow. We'll look like tourists. We'll be tourists, except for the part where we dig up buried treasure in the middle of the night."

Ole watched the Danish countryside scroll past—green fields, red-roofed farmhouses, wind turbines turning slowly against the pale sky.

"You've thought about this a lot."

"I couldn't sleep last night." Malene smiled. "I kept thinking about that chest, sitting there for seventy-five years. All those people searching, and they never found it. And now we have a map. An actual map."

"It's not exactly a map."

"North corner of the house, fifty meters due north, flat circular stone. That's pretty specific." She downshifted as they approached a curve, the engine note dropping. "The house might be gone. The stone might have been moved. A lot can change in seventy-five years. But it's more than anyone else has ever had."

They drove in silence for a while. The Porsche ate up the kilometers, the engine settling into a steady purr at highway speeds.

"There's something else we need to talk about," Ole said finally. "The Fleischer family."

Malene's jaw tightened. "I know."

"The letter was clear. Half the treasure belongs to them."

"The letter was written by a dying man seventy years ago. A man who was an SS soldier, who stole from a war criminal, who made promises to a dying friend." Malene's voice was flat. "Forgive me if I don't feel morally bound by his deathbed agreements."

"It's not about morality. It's about—" Ole stopped, unsure how to finish the sentence.

"About what? Fairness? There's nothing fair about any of this. Your uncle stole those diamonds from a fascist dictator while the world was burning. Half of Europe was starving, dying in concentration camps, getting blown apart by artillery. And we're supposed to worry about being fair to the family of another SS soldier?"

Ole didn't answer. He watched the road and thought about the photograph in the Soldbuch—the smiling young man in the uniform.

"Let's just find the chest first," Malene said, her voice softening. "Everything else can wait."

They reached Copenhagen in the late afternoon. Ole directed Malene to the garage he'd rented on Heimdalsgade—a converted warehouse with individual lockup units. The Porsche fit perfectly, its silver body gleaming under the fluorescent lights.

"I'll need to learn to drive it," Ole said, looking at the car. "Before we leave for Italy."

"Two months. That's plenty of time." Malene handed him the keys. "Start with short trips. Empty parking lots. Build up to highway driving."

They walked back to his apartment together, the spring evening cool and pleasant. The streets were full of people enjoying the weather—couples holding hands, families with children, groups of students heading toward the bars.

Normal people, living normal lives.

Ole wondered if he'd ever feel normal again.

In his apartment, Malene made tea while Ole unpacked the suitcase one more time. The uniform, the pistol, the Soldbuch, the letter. The three diamonds that represented proof—proof that this wasn't a fantasy, that the chest was real, that a fortune lay buried in the Italian mountains.

"We should make a plan," Malene said, settling onto the couch with her tea. "A real plan, not just vague ideas."

"All right. What do we need?"

"First: equipment. Hiking gear, obviously. But also tools—a folding shovel, maybe a small pick. Something we can carry in backpacks without looking suspicious."

Ole made a note. "What else?"

"Maps. Detailed topographical maps of the area around Dongo. We need to identify the house before we get there—if it's still standing, it might be visible on satellite imagery."

"I can search online."

"Do it carefully. Use a VPN. Don't leave traces." Malene's expression was serious. "I know I said the danger is probably minimal, but we should still be careful. If someone's been monitoring searches related to Mussolini's treasure, we don't want to pop up on their radar."

Ole felt a chill. "You think someone might be watching?"

"I think two hundred and fifty million euros is enough money to make people do crazy things. The letter says your uncle was paranoid about being found. Maybe there's a reason."

"Two hundred and fifty million?"

"I ran some rough calculations. Eight kilograms of high-quality diamonds, assuming an average of fifty stones per kilogram... the numbers get very large very quickly." Malene set down her tea. "That's before we factor in rubies, emeralds, whatever else is in there. If the letter is accurate, that chest contains one of the largest private gemstone collections in existence."

Ole stared at her. The number was too big to comprehend.

"That's also why we can't just walk into a bank and start selling diamonds," Malene continued. "We'll need to be extremely careful about how we convert the stones to cash. Small transactions, spread over time, through different channels. Otherwise we'll attract attention from tax authorities, law enforcement, maybe worse."

"Maybe worse?"

"The people who've been looking for this treasure for seventy-five years. If they're still out there. If they're still paying attention." Malene shrugged. "Maybe I'm being paranoid. But your uncle was paranoid too, and he had first-hand experience."

They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of it settling over them.

"So what's the plan?" Ole asked finally.

Malene pulled out her phone and opened a notes app. "Week one: get equipment. Hiking boots, backpacks, appropriate clothing. Nothing too new—we want to look like experienced hikers, not first-timers. Also: start your fitness training. You have two months to get in shape."

"Flattering."

"Realistic. Week two: research. Maps, satellite imagery, historical records. We need to know exactly where we're going before we get there. Week three through eight: continued training and preparation. You learn to drive the Porsche. I brush up on my Italian. We both memorize the route and the landmarks."

"And then?"

"And then we go. First week of July. We tell everyone we're taking a hiking holiday in the Italian Alps. We drive down in the Porsche, find a hotel in the Lake Como area, play tourist for a few days. And when we're confident we know where the chest is buried, we go get it."

Ole nodded slowly. It sounded almost reasonable when she laid it out like that.

"One more thing," Malene said. "The pistol."

"What about it?"

"We're taking it."

"Malene—"

"I'm serious. I'll clean it properly, make sure it works. We'll need to hide it in the car somewhere—maybe in the spare tire well, or behind a panel. But we're not going into this unarmed."

"If we're caught with an illegal weapon in Italy—"

"We won't be caught." Malene met his eyes. "But if we find that chest, and someone else finds us finding it, I want to be able to protect ourselves."

Ole thought about the letter, the warnings, the unknown people who had been searching for seventy-five years.

"All right," he said. "We take the gun."

Malene smiled. It wasn't an entirely reassuring smile.

"Good. Now—I have to go. Exam prep won't do itself, and I've already burned most of today on this adventure." She stood and gathered her things. "Tomorrow we buy boots. And Ole?"

"Yes?"

"Don't tell anyone. Not your friends, not your colleagues, nobody. As far as the world is concerned, we're just a couple of old friends planning a hiking trip."

She left before he could respond.

Ole sat alone in his apartment, surrounded by the relics of a dead man's war, and tried to imagine what his life would look like in three months.

He couldn't.

But for the first time in years, he felt something other than boredom.

He felt alive.
