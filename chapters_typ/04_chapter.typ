The road grew narrower with every kilometer, the pavement crumbling into gravel, the gravel giving way to bare dirt. The Mercedes lurched over ruts and stones, its suspension groaning in protest.

They passed through a village—Garzeno, according to the faded sign. Stone houses with closed shutters, empty streets, not a soul in sight. No dogs barking. No smoke from chimneys. Either the inhabitants had fled, or they were very good at hiding.

"Ghost town," Paul muttered.

Jens's stomach cramped. "We need food. I haven't eaten since yesterday."

"Make it quick. The partisans won't be far behind."

Paul stopped the car in the village square—a small paved area with a dry fountain and a shuttered church. Jens kicked in the door of what had once been a restaurant and found the kitchen ransacked but not entirely empty. Stale bread. A hunk of cured ham, hard as wood but edible. A bottle of wine behind the counter, overlooked by whoever had stripped the place.

They ate standing up, tearing at the bread with their teeth, passing the wine bottle back and forth. It was the best meal Jens had ever had.

"We need to divide the stones," Paul said between bites. "In case we get separated."

"Separated?"

"In case one of us doesn't make it." Paul's voice was flat. "Each of us takes a handful. Enough to buy help along the way. Food, shelter, civilian clothes. Whatever we need."

They walked back to the car and opened the trunk. The chest sat there like a promise—black iron, brass fittings, two keyholes side by side.

Paul produced the keys from Mussolini's jacket. They were small, ornate, numbered one and two.

"Both at the same time," he said. "Turn on three."

The locks clicked. The lid swung up.

Jens had seen Paul's expression when he'd first glimpsed the contents through that cracked door. He'd thought his comrade was exaggerating. He wasn't.

The chest was full to the brim. Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires—thousands of them, catching the weak mountain sunlight and throwing it back in a cascade of fire. Eight kilograms of gemstones, the concentrated wealth of a dictator's twenty-year reign.

"Holy Christ," Jens breathed.

"Everything he stole." Paul reached in and let the stones run through his fingers like water. "Every bribe, every kickback, every piece of confiscated property. All of it converted to portable wealth for his escape."

"He never would have made it to Switzerland."

"No. But now we might."

They each scooped a handful of stones and distributed them through the pockets of their uniforms. Jens felt the unfamiliar weight against his thighs—a fortune in every pocket, enough to live on for years.

Paul tried to lift the chest. His arms trembled with the effort.

"Thirty kilos at least. Maybe more." He let it drop back into the trunk. "The chest wall must be steel-lined. Probably booby-trapped too—try to break it open and it explodes. That's why there are two keys. You need both, turned together, or it destroys itself."

"We can't carry it over the mountains."

"No. We'll have to bury it." Paul slammed the trunk closed. "Find a landmark, something that will still be here in five years. Ten years. However long it takes for the world to forget."

They wrestled the chest into the back seat—easier to grab if they needed to run—and drove on. The road climbed steeply, switchbacking through pine forest, the air growing colder with every turn.

Jens watched the landscape and tried to plan. He didn't believe in Switzerland. The mountains were too high, the distances too great, and they had neither map nor compass. What he believed in was survival—and survival meant surrendering to the Americans, not fighting through partisan-controlled territory to a neutral border.

But he would wait until after the chest was buried. Whatever happened next, he needed to know where the treasure was hidden.

The ambush came without warning.

One moment they were rounding a bend, the road ahead clear. The next, the windshield exploded inward and Paul was jerking in his seat, dark flowers blooming on his chest.

The car went off the road.

Jens felt the impact as a series of shocks—bushes tearing at the bodywork, small trees snapping, rocks slamming against the undercarriage. Then they were in a streambed, the car tilted at an angle, cold water rushing past the front wheels.

He looked at Paul. Two holes in his chest, blood soaking through the gray-green wool. But his eyes were open.

"The chest," Paul gasped. "Take it. Run."

"I can't leave you—"

"I'm dead already." Blood bubbled at the corner of Paul's mouth. "Get the chest. Get out of here. They probably didn't see you—I was driving, they focused on me. You might have a chance."

Jens could hear voices above them on the road. Excited shouts in Italian. They'd be coming down to finish the job any second.

"My key," Paul said. His hand fumbled at his jacket pocket. "Take it. And promise me—promise me you'll find my family. My mother and sister. They live in Koblenz, Florinspfaffengasse. You have to share the treasure with them."

"I promise."

"Swear it."

"I swear."

Paul's bloody hand found Jens's and pressed the key into his palm. "Go. Now. While there's still time."

Jens grabbed the chest from the back seat—Christ, it was heavy—and rolled out of the car on the downhill side, away from the road. He crawled through the stream, the icy water soaking through his uniform, dragging the chest behind him.

Fifty meters downstream, he found a hollow in the bank, screened by brush. He wedged himself into it and pulled the chest close, making himself as small as possible.

Gunfire erupted behind him. Short bursts—Paul's MP40, still fighting. Then answering fire, heavier, from multiple weapons.

Then silence.

Jens pressed his face into the mud and didn't move.

He lay there for what felt like hours. The voices came closer, then receded. He heard the trunk being opened, the sound of rummaging. Excited chatter—they'd found something in the luggage, probably Mussolini's clothes, Clara Petacci's dresses. The word "Mussolini" repeated over and over, with increasing agitation.

They didn't come looking for him. They didn't know he existed.

Eventually the voices faded entirely. Jens waited another thirty minutes, counting his heartbeats, before he dared to move.

He crept back to the car. Paul was still in the driver's seat, but he wasn't Paul anymore—just a thing, riddled with bullets, eyes staring at nothing. The partisans had taken everything of value: weapons, ammunition, food, the contents of the trunk. All that remained was the car itself and the body of a man Jens had called friend.

He found a pocket knife in one of the door compartments, overlooked in the search. It wasn't much, but it was something.

"I'm sorry," he said to what had been Paul Fleischer. "I'll keep my promise."

Then he picked up the chest and started walking.

The stone house was visible from below—a chimney rising above the tree line, maybe three hundred meters up the slope. Jens fixed his eyes on it and climbed, stopping every few minutes to rest his burning muscles and listen for pursuit.

Nothing. The forest was silent except for birdsong and the whisper of wind through the pines.

The house was abandoned, as he'd hoped. Stone walls, tile roof, wooden shutters hanging crooked on their hinges. Inside: a small kitchen, a living room with a cold fireplace, a bedroom with a bare mattress. Dust covered everything. No one had been here in months, maybe years.

Behind the house, a shed. And in the shed—a pick and a shovel, rusted but functional.

Jens could have wept with relief.

He studied the terrain. The house sat on a small rise, exposed on three sides. To the north, the ground sloped away into forest before rising again toward the higher peaks. If he buried the chest in the forest, it would be nearly impossible to find again. He needed a landmark. Something permanent.

He stood at what he judged to be the north corner of the house and walked due north, counting his paces. Fifty meters brought him to a small clearing where the ground was relatively flat and the soil looked soft enough to dig.

At the edge of the clearing lay a stone—flat, almost perfectly circular, the size of a small table. Natural formation, not placed by human hands. It would still be here in fifty years.

Jens started digging.

The work went quickly. The soil was loose, free of major roots, and fear drove his arms with manic energy. Within an hour, he had a hole deep enough to hide the chest completely.

He lowered it in carefully, checking the orientation one last time. North corner of the house, fifty meters due north, flat circular stone marking the spot.

He filled the hole, tamped the earth down, and placed the stone on top. Then he spent another hour disguising his work—scattering leaves and dead branches, roughing up the surrounding ground to hide the fresh digging.

When he was finished, you couldn't tell anyone had been there.

Jens walked back to the house and looked north. The circular stone was barely visible through the trees—just a gray shape among the browns and greens of the forest floor.

Perfect.

Now he just had to survive long enough to come back for it.

He stripped off his SS uniform and burned it in the fireplace, watching the fabric curl and blacken. In a wardrobe in the bedroom, he found clothes that must have belonged to the house's owner—rough wool trousers, a peasant's shirt, a battered jacket. They fit poorly, but they would do.

He buried the soldier's book and his identification papers in the ashes of the fire. If he was captured now, he was just another refugee, one of millions wandering the broken roads of postwar Europe.

He kept only two things: the handful of diamonds in his pockets, and the two keys to the chest.

Then he started walking south.

Three days later, starving and exhausted, Jens walked into an American patrol with his hands raised.

They searched him, found the diamonds, and assumed he was a looter—which, in a sense, he was. They didn't find the keys, which he'd sewn into the lining of his stolen jacket.

The Americans handed him over to a British processing unit, who handed him over to the Danes. Someone, somewhere, discovered he'd been SS—probably from records captured in Germany—and suddenly he was no longer a refugee but a war criminal.

He spent four years in a prison camp before they let him go.

By the time he got back to Odense, his sister had married and moved into their parents' house. He couldn't tell her about the treasure—couldn't tell anyone—so he hid the suitcase with its contents in the crawl space and waited.

He would go back for the chest. He just needed time. Time to plan, time to save money for the journey, time for the world to forget about Mussolini and his missing fortune.

He waited seven years.

Then his heart started failing, and the doctors told him he needed surgery—risky surgery, the kind you might not wake up from.

The night before the operation, he sat down and wrote a letter.

Just in case.
