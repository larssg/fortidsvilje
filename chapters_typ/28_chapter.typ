The house smelled of dust and disuse. Shutters blocked the windows. A single bare bulb cast harsh light across a room dominated by a scarred wooden table.

Russo sat at the head, cigarette in hand, watching as his men pushed the Danes into chairs across from him. The chest rested on the table between them, its brass surface gleaming dully in the electric light.

"So," Russo said pleasantly, "here we are."

Ole kept his eyes on the old man. The elegant tourist from the beach bar was gone, replaced by something harder, colder. A predator who'd finally cornered his prey.

"The keys," Russo continued. "I'm told you have them. And I'm told this chest will explode quite spectacularly if we try to open it without them."

"We told your men," Malene said. "We don't have the keys."

"Yes, I heard." Russo drew on his cigarette. "I don't believe you."

He nodded to the waiter, who stepped forward and grabbed Ole's arm, pulling him roughly to his feet.

"The keys are in the car," Ole said quickly. "Hidden under the passenger seat."

The waiter looked to Russo, who nodded. "Bring him. If he's lying, shoot the woman in the knee."

"I'm not lying."

"Then you have nothing to worry about."

Outside, the afternoon sun felt obscenely normal. Birds sang in the trees. Somewhere down the mountain, tourists were eating gelato and taking photographs.

Ole walked to the Porsche with the waiter behind him, the pistol a constant pressure against his spine. He opened the passenger door and knelt, reaching under the seat.

His hand found the keys first—the two brass keys they'd retrieved from the locksmith in Odense.

And then, behind them, the pistol.

He'd taped it there weeks ago, before they'd left Denmark. Paranoia, Malene had called it. Preparation, he'd argued.

Now it might save their lives.

"I need to work them free," Ole said, keeping his voice steady. "They're taped to the frame."

"Hurry up."

Ole's fingers found the tape securing the weapon. He pulled slowly, carefully, feeling the gun come loose.

"Got them," he said.

He half-turned, offering the keys with his left hand. The waiter's eyes went to them—a moment's distraction, nothing more.

Ole completed the turn and shot him in the chest.

The report was deafening in the quiet afternoon. The waiter staggered backward, surprise frozen on his face, then collapsed into the gravel. His pistol discharged as he fell, the bullet going wide, punching through the Porsche's fender.

Ole didn't hesitate. He stepped over the body, collected the waiter's weapon, and moved toward the house.

Everything felt distant now. Clear. Like watching himself from somewhere outside his body.

The door was still open.

Inside, Malene was still bound to her chair. The street sweeper stood behind her, one hand on her shoulder, the other holding a pistol that was now swinging toward Ole.

Ole fired first.

The shot caught the street sweeper in the throat. He went down thrashing, fingers scrabbling at the wound, blood spraying across the wooden floor.

On the table, Russo sat frozen, his hand halfway to the pistol in his jacket. Ole leveled his weapon at the old man's chest.

"Don't."

Russo's hand stopped. His expression shifted from shock to something almost like admiration.

"Impressive," he said. "I underestimated you."

"Where are your other men?"

"There are no others. Not yet. The cleaning team wasn't scheduled to arrive until tomorrow."

"Cleaning team?"

Russo smiled thinly. "Someone has to dispose of the bodies. Yours, originally. Now, I suppose, theirs."

Ole crossed to Malene, keeping the pistol aimed at Russo, and began working at her bonds. The rope was tight, cutting into her wrists.

"You won't get away with this," Russo said conversationally. "My organization has resources you can't imagine. We've been searching for this treasure for seventy years. Do you think we'll simply let you disappear?"

The ropes came free. Malene pulled her hands in front of her, rubbing the circulation back into them.

"We'll take our chances," Ole said.

Russo reached for his cigarettes. "May I?"

Ole nodded. The old man lit a cigarette with steady hands, watching them through the smoke.

"You know," Russo said, "we could come to an arrangement. There's enough wealth in that chest for everyone. You take your share, I take mine, and we go our separate ways. No one else needs to die."

"Your men were going to kill us."

"A misunderstanding. Overzealous subordinates. I never intended—"

Movement behind him. The waiter in the doorway, bloodied but alive, raising his pistol with trembling hands.

Ole spun and fired, but the waiter's shot came first.

Russo jerked backward, a neat hole appearing in the center of his forehead. The waiter collapsed, Ole's second bullet finding its mark.

Silence.

Ole stood in the center of the room, pistol raised, ears ringing. Two bodies on the floor. One slumped in a chair. The smell of gunpowder and blood thick in the air.

"The waiter," Malene whispered. "He shot Russo?"

"I don't think that was an accident."

They stared at each other, the reality of what had happened slowly settling in. Three men dead. A fortune in diamonds on the table between them. And somewhere in Rome, an organization that would never stop hunting them.

"We need to go," Ole said. "Now."

They worked quickly, erasing their presence from the house. Ole found a towel and wiped every surface they might have touched. Malene grabbed the chest—heavier than it looked, but manageable.

The waiter's body still lay in the gravel. Ole retrieved his phone, deleted any recent calls, and dropped it in the weeds.

"What about them?" Malene asked. "The bodies?"

"Leave them. The cleaning team will find them tomorrow. By then, we'll be far away."

They loaded the chest into the Porsche's front trunk. Ole got behind the wheel, started the engine, and drove down the forest road without looking back.

The drive back to the hotel took fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes for his hands to stop shaking, for his heart rate to approach something like normal.

He'd killed two men.

Shot them at close range and watched them die.

The weight of it sat in his chest like a stone. A high school teacher from Odense. A man who'd never raised his voice in anger, never thrown a punch.

And now he had blood on his hands that would never wash away.

"Stay in the car," he told Malene. "I'll check us out. Family emergency."

She nodded, her face pale in the late-afternoon light.

Inside the hotel, Ole retrieved their bags, paid the bill, invented a story about a sick relative back home. The desk clerk expressed sympathy and wished them safe travels.

Ten minutes later, they were on the road, heading south toward Milan, the chest of diamonds riding in the trunk like a bomb waiting to detonate.

"We're taking a different route home," Ole said. "Through Austria. Just in case."

"In case of what?"

"In case anyone's following. Before we left the mountain, I searched Russo's room at the hotel. He had a GPS tracker—that's how they knew where we were. He could see exactly where the car was parked."

Malene absorbed this. "Then they've been watching us the whole time."

"Since Dongo, at least." Ole checked the mirror—nothing but empty road behind them. "I found the tracker and destroyed it. But there might be others in the organization who knew his plans."

"The cleaning team."

"The cleaning team. Or whoever gives them their orders."

They drove in silence for a while, the Italian countryside giving way to suburbs, then the outskirts of Milan.

"You saved my life," Malene said finally. "Back there, in the house. I thought—when the shot went off, when you went outside—I thought you were dead."

"I almost was."

"What you did..." She trailed off. "Could you do it again? If you had to?"

Ole thought about it. The waiter raising his pistol. The street sweeper reaching for his gun. The cold clarity that had descended in those moments, erasing everything but the need to survive.

"Yes," he said. "If I had to. If it meant keeping you safe."

She reached across and took his hand. They held on to each other as the highway stretched north, toward the mountains, toward home.

Behind them, in a house hidden by forest and scrub, three bodies lay cooling in the summer heat.

Ahead of them, a chest full of diamonds waited to be opened.

And in Rome, somewhere in a palazzo with too many secrets, people were about to learn that their treasure—and their assassin—had both been lost.
