April-May 1945

Six days of walking. Six nights of hiding.

Jens moved like a ghost through the ruined landscape, traveling only after dark, lying motionless in thickets and hollows during the daylight hours. The cheese from the old man's farm had run out on the third day, and since then he'd survived on stream water and whatever he could scavenge—wild onions, dandelion greens, once a handful of unripe olives that turned his stomach inside out.

He was careful. Wide detours around every settlement. No chances, no shortcuts, no risks. The memory of the old farmer—the shotgun, the cracking of vertebrae—haunted him in his waking hours and vanished completely when he slept. He didn't know which was worse.

On the seventh day, everything changed.

He was dozing in a thicket near the road when he heard engines. Not trucks—something lighter, moving fast. He raised his head carefully and saw a military column rounding the bend below.

American.

The lead vehicle was a Jeep with a white star on the hood. Behind it came a covered truck, and behind that marched a column of German soldiers—fifty, maybe sixty men, shuffling along in the dust. Two more Jeeps brought up the rear.

Prisoners. Being transported somewhere south.

Jens's heart began to pound. This was his chance. If he could slip into the column unnoticed, he could surrender without being searched. The diamonds and keys would stay hidden. He would become just another captured soldier, processed and shipped to a camp.

He studied the column's movement, calculating angles and timing. The road curved sharply just below his position. For a few seconds, neither the lead nor rear vehicles would have a clear line of sight to the middle of the march.

He waited until the moment was right. Then he moved.

The Germans saw him coming—there was no way to avoid that. He burst out of the undergrowth and threw himself into their ranks, stumbling, catching himself, falling into step with the rest.

Muttering. Curses. A large soldier beside him glared.

"That was quite an entrance."

"Didn't want to surprise the Americans." Jens kept his voice low, his eyes forward. "They might shoot first and ask questions later."

"They won't notice. We haven't been registered or searched. They've just been scooping us up as they go—must be twenty new men since I joined three days ago."

"Where are we headed?"

"Como first, then Milan by train. After that, who knows? A camp somewhere, probably."

The large soldier looked him over—the ragged uniform, the hollow cheeks, the thousand-yard stare that marked every veteran of the Eastern Front.

"SS?"

"Does it matter?"

"Not anymore." The soldier spat in the dust. "The war's over. We just haven't stopped walking yet."

They marched for hours along the lake road. The landscape was beautiful—terraced hillsides, medieval villages, the deep blue water stretching toward distant mountains—but none of them could appreciate it. They were too tired, too hungry, too broken.

Jens studied his fellow prisoners as they walked. Gaunt faces, hollow eyes, uniforms that were more patches than cloth. A defeated army, shuffling toward captivity.

He looked down at himself. His own uniform was no better—torn, stained, held together by habit more than thread. When had he last received fresh clothing? He couldn't remember. Months, certainly. Maybe longer.

But he was still a soldier. He straightened his spine, lifted his chin, lengthened his stride. As long as he wore the uniform, he would carry himself like a man. For his own sake, if no one else's.

They stopped once for water at a village fountain. Twice they were given bread—American bread, soft and white, impossibly fresh compared to the hard crusts Jens had been eating for years. He ate slowly, savoring every bite.

The villages they passed through were silent, shuttered, waiting. Occasionally a curtain would twitch, a face would appear briefly in a window, but no one came out. No one wanted to interact with the defeated army passing through.

Jens understood. He would have done the same.

Como appeared in late afternoon—a real city, elegant villas lining the lakefront, palm trees and formal gardens. The kind of place wealthy people came for holidays, in the world before the war.

Now it was empty. The restaurants were closed, the hotels shuttered, the promenades deserted. Even the birds seemed to have left.

The column wound through the streets to the train station, where the American officer went inside to negotiate with the Italian stationmaster. There was a lot of pointing and gesturing before they reached an agreement.

They marched another kilometer to a large warehouse beside the tracks. Red brick, high windows, heavy doors that clanged shut behind them like the gates of a prison.

Which, Jens supposed, was exactly what it was now.

Food and water arrived an hour later—bread, cheese, buckets of water with tin cups. The prisoners lined up in something approximating military order, received their rations, and found places along the walls to sit.

Conversation was muted at first. Everyone was exhausted. But gradually, as bellies filled and bodies rested, the talking began.

"Where were you captured?"

"How long have you been marching?"

"Do you think they'll shoot us?"

Jens stayed quiet, listening. The large soldier he'd walked with—Heinrich, he'd learned—sat beside him, equally silent.

"You're not German," Heinrich said finally. "The accent."

"Danish."

"Shouldn't you be with Frikorps Danmark?"

"I enlisted directly into the SS. 1941. I was... idealistic."

Heinrich grunted. "We all were, once. Look where it got us."

They sat in silence as darkness fell and the warehouse filled with the sounds of sleeping men—snores, coughs, the occasional whimper of a nightmare.

Jens didn't sleep. He lay on the hard floor and thought about the chest, buried in the mountains, waiting.

Someday he would go back for it.

Someday.

The next morning, they were loaded onto cattle cars—forty men per car, no room to sit, no air to breathe. The train crawled south through the Italian countryside, stopping frequently for reasons no one explained.

Milan. A larger camp, more prisoners, more waiting.

Then transport again. And again.

Eventually, Jens lost track of the camps and the trains and the days. The war ended—he heard about it from other prisoners, celebrated with a silence that felt like relief—but the captivity continued.

The Americans handed him to the British. The British handed him to a processing unit. The processing unit discovered he was Danish and handed him to representatives of the new Danish government.

Somewhere along the way, someone found his name in a captured SS roster.

Jens Raben. Danish national. Enlisted 1941. Service in the East, in Italy, in places that were now becoming synonymous with atrocity.

The Danes didn't treat SS volunteers kindly.

He was shipped to a camp. Tried, after a fashion. Sentenced.

Four years.

He served every day of it.

When they finally released him, he took a train back to Odense. The city looked the same—the same streets, the same buildings, the same church spires against the gray sky—but everything had changed.

He had changed.

His sister lived in their parents' house now, with her husband and their children. She opened the door when he knocked, and for a long moment they just stared at each other.

"Jens."

"Lillian."

She didn't invite him in. Didn't embrace him. Just stood in the doorway with her arms crossed, her face expressionless.

"The neighbors will talk," she said finally. "You can't stay."

"I know."

"I told everyone you died in the war."

"Maybe I did."

She looked at him then—really looked, seeing whatever was left of the brother she'd known before he'd put on the uniform and marched away to fight for the wrong side.

"There's a room above the bakery on Vestergade. The owner owes our father a favor. He'll let you stay."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. And don't come back here. My husband doesn't want the children to know they have an uncle who—" She stopped herself. "Just don't come back."

She closed the door.

Jens stood on the step for a long moment, looking at the house where he'd grown up. Then he turned and walked away.

He got a job at a factory. He rented the room above the bakery. He lived quietly, invisibly, speaking to no one, noticed by no one.

Every night, he thought about the chest.

He could see it in his mind's eye—black iron, brass fittings, buried beneath a flat stone in a clearing in the Italian mountains. The keys were hidden in the lining of his jacket, which he kept in a box under his bed. The diamonds were in a sock in the same box, the few he'd managed to hide from the Americans.

He could go back. He could dig up the fortune and start a new life somewhere far away, somewhere no one knew his name or his history.

But not yet. It was too soon. There would be people watching, people asking questions. He needed to wait.

So he waited.

One year. Two. Five.

He worked at the factory. He ate his meals alone. He walked through the city in the evenings, past the house where his sister lived, never stopping, never knocking.

Seven years passed.

And then his heart began to fail.

The doctor was matter-of-fact about it. A valve was damaged—weakened by malnutrition during the war, probably, or by the stress of combat. It could be repaired, but the surgery was risky.

"How risky?"

"One in three don't survive."

One in three. Jens thought about the men he'd seen die over the years—shot, shelled, bayoneted, burned. One in three seemed like good odds by comparison.

"Do it."

The surgery was scheduled for the following week.

The night before, Jens sat in his small room and wrote a letter.

He wrote everything. The convoy. The theft. Paul's death. The burial of the chest. The promise he'd made to a dying friend.

He addressed it to no one in particular. To whoever might find it, years or decades from now, when he was long dead and the world had forgotten there was ever a war.

Then he packed the letter in a suitcase along with his uniform, his Soldbuch, his pistol, and the diamonds. He walked to his sister's house after midnight and let himself in through the back door.

The crawl space behind the bookcase was exactly as he remembered. He'd hidden things there as a child—toys, coins, a diary he'd never wanted anyone to read.

Now he hid the suitcase.

He left the house without waking anyone, walked back to his room, and tried to sleep.

The surgery was at eight in the morning.

Jens Raben's heart stopped at 9:47.

They couldn't restart it.
