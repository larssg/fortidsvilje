The phone rang in the darkness.

It was an old phone—rotary dial, heavy black Bakelite—sitting on a side table in the corner of the sitting room. The curtains were drawn against the afternoon sun, and the room lay in perpetual twilight.

A man in a dark suit entered and lifted the receiver without speaking. He listened for precisely twelve seconds, said "Grazie," and hung up.

Then he walked down a long corridor lined with paintings—old masters, or convincing copies—and knocked gently on a door at the far end.

"Avanti."

The office beyond was large and richly furnished: mahogany desk, leather chairs, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Behind the desk sat a man in his seventies, silver-haired, reading glasses perched on his nose.

"A message from Dongo, Signor Russo."

Russo looked up. His eyes were sharp despite his age—the eyes of a man who had spent a lifetime watching and waiting.

"And?"

"Two Danes have booked a room at Albergo Dongo. Fourteen days in July."

The room went very still.

Russo removed his glasses and set them on the desk. "Danes."

"Yes, signore. A man and a woman. The woman made the reservation this evening."

"Their names?"

The servant recited the information: names, email addresses, phone numbers. Russo wrote it all down in a leather notebook, his handwriting precise and unhurried.

"That will be all, Marco. Send Giancarlo to me."

"Sì, signore."

The servant withdrew. Russo sat alone in the silence, staring at the names he'd written.

Danes.

In all the years they'd been watching, they'd had perhaps a dozen alerts. Historians writing books. Journalists chasing stories. Treasure hunters following rumors. All of them had come to nothing.

But they'd always paid special attention to Danes.

The story was old now—so old that most people had forgotten it, or never known it in the first place. But Russo remembered. He'd heard it from his father, who'd heard it from men who'd been there.

April 1945. Mussolini fleeing north toward Switzerland, his dream of empire crumbling around him. With him: his mistress, a handful of loyalists, and a chest full of diamonds.

The chest never made it to Switzerland.

According to the witnesses—the restaurant owner, the locals who'd seen the black limousine tear through the streets—two SS soldiers had stolen the Duce's jacket while he was in the bathroom. They'd driven off into the mountains with the chest in the trunk, and that was the last anyone had seen of it.

The partisans had caught up with them somewhere above Garzeno. There'd been an ambush. One of the soldiers—a German named Paul Fleischer—had died in the car. But the chest was gone. The keys were gone. And the second soldier was gone.

No one knew his name. No one knew what had happened to him.

But Clara Petacci, Mussolini's mistress, had heard the two men talking in the car. Her German was rudimentary, but she'd understood enough.

One was German. The other was Danish.

For seventy-five years, the organization had been watching for Danes.

A knock at the door. Giancarlo entered, leaning heavily on a cane. He was older than Russo—nearly ninety—one of the last survivors of the original group that had started searching for the treasure in the years after the war.

"You have news?"

"Sit down, old friend." Russo gestured to a chair. "Two Danes have booked a room in Dongo. Fourteen days in July."

Giancarlo lowered himself carefully into the seat. His hands trembled, but his eyes were steady.

"Danes. After all this time."

"It could be nothing. Tourists who want to see Lake Como."

"For fourteen days? In Dongo?" Giancarlo shook his head. "There's nothing in Dongo for tourists. A few restaurants, a square, a view of the lake. You see it in a day. You move on."

"I know."

"So what do we do?"

Russo leaned back in his chair. "We have assets in Denmark. Two men at the embassy in Copenhagen—sympathizers, not members, but reliable. I'll have them run a background check on these tourists. See who they are, what they do, whether there's any connection to the war."

"And if there is?"

"Then we escalate. Put surveillance on them. Watch where they go, what they do. And when they come to Dongo, we'll be ready."

Giancarlo nodded slowly. "The others should be informed."

"Not yet. Let's see what the background check reveals first. No point alarming everyone over two tourists who might turn out to be nothing."

"And if they're not nothing?"

Russo was silent for a moment. Through the window, he could hear the sounds of Rome—traffic, voices, the eternal hum of the city.

"Then we do what we've always planned to do," he said finally. "We let them find the treasure. We let them dig it up. And then we take it from them."

"By whatever means necessary."

"By whatever means necessary."

Giancarlo smiled—a thin, cold expression. "I've waited seventy-five years for this moment. I was beginning to think I'd die before it came."

"You may still die before it comes. We don't know anything yet."

"But you feel it, don't you?" The old man leaned forward. "Something is different this time. I can see it in your face."

Russo didn't answer. But yes—he felt it. A tingling at the base of his spine, a quickening of the pulse. After decades of false alarms, something about this felt real.

Two Danes. Fourteen days in Dongo. In July.

It might be nothing.

But it might be everything.

After Giancarlo left, Russo made two phone calls.

The first was to Alberto, the manager of Albergo Dongo, who had been on their payroll for thirty years. Russo asked him to keep a close eye on the Danish guests when they arrived—note where they went, what they asked about, whether they showed any interest in the mountains or the history of the area.

The second call was to Copenhagen.

The man who answered spoke Italian with a Danish accent. He worked at the Italian embassy—a minor functionary, a paper-pusher, someone no one would ever notice. But he was useful.

Russo gave him the names and contact information for the two tourists.

"Find out everything you can. Employment, finances, family connections. I want to know who these people are and why they're coming to Dongo."

"How deep should I go?"

"As deep as necessary. But be discreet. If they're what I think they might be, we don't want to spook them."

"And if I find something?"

"Call me immediately. Day or night."

Russo hung up and sat alone in the growing darkness.

He thought about the unknown soldier—the Dane who had vanished into the chaos of postwar Europe with a fortune in diamonds. Dead now, certainly. But he must have told someone. Written something down. Left some record of where the chest was buried.

That information was out there. It had to be.

And now, perhaps, someone had found it.

Russo poured himself a whiskey and carried it to the window. Rome spread out below him, a maze of ancient streets and modern traffic, churches and monuments and ordinary lives.

Somewhere out there, two Danes were planning a trip to Lake Como.

They thought they were going on a treasure hunt.

They had no idea they were walking into a trap.

Russo raised his glass to the darkening sky.

"Salute," he said softly.

Then he drank.
