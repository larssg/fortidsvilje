The train crawled north through a landscape of ruins and reconstruction, single-track connections forcing constant delays as they waited in sidings for oncoming traffic to pass.

Jens sat in his first-class compartment, watching the devastation scroll past the window. Three years since the war's end, and Germany was still more rubble than nation. But cranes rose from the ruins now, scaffolding climbed the shells of buildings, and at every station, vendors crowded the platforms selling food and hope.

He'd dressed carefully for this journey—good suit, quality overcoat, polished shoes. The appearance of a successful businessman, the kind of man who passed through checkpoints with a nod rather than an interrogation.

His papers identified him as Dieter Schmidt, textile merchant from Flensburg. The documents were forgeries, crafted by a man he'd met in a Munich tavern, but they were good enough to fool the police who moved through the cars at every major stop.

The real Dieter Schmidt—whoever he'd been—would never miss his identity. In postwar Germany, thousands of men had simply ceased to exist. One more borrowed name changed nothing.

The train pulled into Hanover as evening fell.

A conductor moved through the cars, announcing a three-hour delay. Problems with the locomotive, repairs needed on the track ahead. Passengers were free to stretch their legs, find food, return before departure.

Jens considered remaining in his seat—safer, smarter—but his stomach had other ideas. He'd eaten nothing since morning, and the smell of cooking from the station square was impossible to ignore.

He stepped onto the platform and into the fading light.

The restaurant was called Maximilian, accessed by stairs that led down from the street into what had once been a cellar. Noise and warmth spilled up through the doorway—laughter, conversation, the clink of glasses.

Inside, Jens found a seat near the fireplace and ordered beer, sausages, and sauerkraut. The food was good, the beer cold, and he began to relax for the first time since leaving Munich.

A mistake.

The young men at the next table were drinking heavily, trading war stories with the aggressive camaraderie of veterans who'd lost more than they'd won. Jens tried to avoid eye contact, but they drew him in anyway—where had he served, what unit, which front?

He answered vaguely. Northern postings. Logistics work. Nothing heroic.

Two of them exchanged glances. Something in their expressions shifted—calculation replacing fellowship.

Jens finished his second beer and made his excuses. Time to catch his train.

Outside, the street was dark, the only light a single lantern above the restaurant entrance. He'd walked perhaps fifty meters when the blow came—a fist or club to the back of his skull, hard enough to send him staggering into a pile of salvaged bricks.

He caught himself against the rubble and turned.

Two shapes in the darkness. The young men from the restaurant, moving to bracket him.

"Nice suit," one said. "Must be doing well for yourself."

"Better than us," the other added. "That's not fair, is it?"

The first one lunged.

The years fell away. Suddenly Jens was back in the trenches outside Stalingrad, where close combat meant survival and hesitation meant death. The cold clarity descended like a familiar weight.

He ducked the punch, letting it pass over his head, and drove his fist into the attacker's face. Cartilage crunched. Teeth scattered. The man doubled forward, and Jens brought his knee up into his chin with everything he had.

As the first attacker crumpled, Jens grabbed a brick from the pile and swung it in a vicious arc, connecting with the side of the man's skull. The sound was wet, final.

The second man had frozen, his courage evaporating as his friend collapsed.

Jens took a step forward, brick raised. "Run."

He ran.

Jens didn't wait to see if he'd return with reinforcements. He dropped the brick and walked—not running, nothing to draw attention—toward the station. His heart was hammering, but his hands were steady.

Some skills never left you.

The train was boarding when he reached the platform. Jens found his compartment, took his seat by the window, and watched the platform empty as departure approached.

Three figures appeared at the far end of the station, moving fast, scanning the carriages.

The second attacker. And he'd brought friends.

The train began to move.

Jens watched the men sprint along the platform, watched them leap onto the last carriage as the train gathered speed. They were on board. Hunting him.

He grabbed his suitcase and headed toward the front of the train.

The corridors were packed—travelers standing, sitting on luggage, pressed against walls. Jens pushed through them, earning curses and complaints, but he didn't slow. Behind him, somewhere in the trailing carriages, his pursuers were doing the same.

He reached the baggage car. Locked.

The corridor behind him was filling with angry passengers, disturbed by the commotion. Any moment now, the hunters would appear.

A conductor emerged from the baggage car, key in hand, and Jens slipped through the closing door behind him. Inside, the car was stacked floor to ceiling with luggage, a narrow aisle running down the center.

No hiding places. Nowhere to run.

He found a shelf, threw packages aside to make space, and wedged himself in, piling luggage in front to create a screen. The train swayed beneath him. His breath sounded impossibly loud in the confined space.

Minutes passed.

The door opened. Voices.

"—no one here, you can see that."

"We need to check properly. He's on this train."

"What did he do to you that's worth all this trouble?"

"He attacked our friend. Beat him half to death."

Jens heard footsteps in the aisle, heard them pause near his hiding place. He eased his hand toward the pistol in his coat.

"Nothing here but baggage," the conductor said. "You're wasting my time."

A long moment. Then the footsteps retreated, and the door slammed.

Jens exhaled.

But he couldn't stay here. At the next station, they'd search again, more thoroughly. He needed to get off this train.

The side door of the baggage car opened onto darkness and rushing wind. Jens stood in the gap, watching the landscape blur past, waiting for the right moment—a place to hide, a speed slow enough to survive the jump.

The train was climbing a grade, losing momentum. A grove of trees bordered the track, dense enough to provide cover.

He clutched his suitcase to his chest and jumped.

The impact drove the breath from his lungs. He rolled through tall grass, crashed into underbrush, and lay still as the train's lights disappeared around a curve.

No screeching brakes. No shouts of alarm.

He'd made it.

Jens walked through the night, following the railway tracks north, his suitcase growing heavier with each kilometer. The moon provided enough light to navigate, and the spring night was cold but not deadly.

Toward dawn, he found an abandoned barn at the edge of a forest. Inside, a pile of straw offered something like comfort. He burrowed in, wrapped his coat tight, and slept.

The next morning, he walked into a small town and found a hotel restaurant just opening for breakfast. He ate like a starving man—eggs, bread, sausage, coffee—then studied the newspaper that had been left on a nearby table.

The headline made his stomach drop:

WANTED: YOUNG MAN SOUGHT FOR VIOLENT ASSAULT

The story described an attack in Hanover, a victim in critical condition, a suspect who'd thrown luggage from a moving train before escaping. Mid-twenties, well-dressed, blue eyes, reddish-brown hair.

Every conductor on the line would have this description by now.

The trains were closed to him.

Jens finished his coffee and considered his options. He couldn't walk to Kiel—too far, too exposed. He needed transport. Something private, something that wouldn't require showing papers or answering questions.

He needed a car.

The mechanic's workshop sat at the edge of town—more shed than building, with a single petrol pump out front and a hand-painted sign advertising repairs. Jens found the owner beneath an ancient truck, banging at something with a wrench.

"I'm looking for a vehicle," Jens said when the man emerged. "Something reliable. Do you have anything for sale?"

The mechanic studied him with the slow appraisal of a man who'd seen too much to be easily fooled. "You're not from around here."

"Flensburg. Up north. I'm a traveling salesman."

"Long way from home."

"That's why I need a car."

The mechanic lit a pipe, taking his time. Finally, he led Jens behind the building to a lean-to sheltering a small Opel P4—not new, but well-maintained, the kind of anonymous vehicle that wouldn't attract attention.

Perfect.

They haggled. Jens paid cash. The mechanic filled the tank and handed over the keys with something almost like respect.

"You know how to handle yourself," he said. "I can see it."

Jens said nothing. He got behind the wheel, started the engine, and drove north toward Bremen, putting distance between himself and the railway, between himself and the violence that seemed to follow wherever he went.

The road stretched ahead, empty and open.

In a few hours, he'd be in Kiel. The business with Udo, the legitimate life he was building—it was still possible. Still waiting.

He just had to stay alive long enough to reach it.
