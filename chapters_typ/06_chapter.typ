The palazzo occupied a narrow lot on the Via dei Coronari, wedged between an antiquarian bookshop and a building that had been under renovation since the Berlusconi years. From the street, it looked like just another crumbling Roman tenement—faded ochre walls, a shuttered shoe store on the ground level, pigeons roosting in the cornices.

That was the idea.

Inside, through a courtyard gate that opened only for those who knew the code, the building transformed. The walls were freshly plastered. The marble floors gleamed. The furniture was antique—real antique, not reproduction—and the art on the walls had been appraised in the high six figures.

The meeting room was on the second floor, behind doors thick enough to stop a bullet. Crystal chandeliers hung from the frescoed ceiling. Heavy curtains blocked the windows, keeping the room in perpetual twilight.

Five men sat around a mahogany table that had once belonged to a cardinal.

Two of them were old—genuinely old, in their late eighties or early nineties, the kind of old that made every movement careful and every breath audible. They sat at opposite ends of the table like bookends, their eyes sharp despite the ravages of time.

The other three were younger, perhaps in their fifties or sixties, though they deferred to the old men with a respect that bordered on reverence.

At the head of the room, above the fireplace, hung a portrait. Mussolini in his prime—jaw thrust forward, chest blazing with medals, the Roman salute frozen in oil paint. The eyes seemed to follow anyone who moved.

A servant circulated with coffee and mineral water, silent as a ghost. When he withdrew, closing the doors behind him, the elder of the two old men cleared his throat.

"Gentlemen. You know why we are here. The question before us is whether to continue funding the Dongo operation, or whether the time has come to accept that the treasure is lost forever."

His voice was thin but steady, the voice of a man who had been giving orders for seventy years and expected them to be followed.

The other old man—frailer, with hands that trembled against the tabletop—rapped his knuckle against the wood. "Continue. We must continue. We are the only ones who know with certainty that the treasure exists. Everyone else is chasing rumors. We have proof."

"Proof that is seventy-five years old," said one of the younger men. A lawyer's face, careful and calculating. "With respect, the world has changed. The people who might have come looking for the treasure are dead. Their children are old. Their grandchildren have never heard the story."

"And yet the treasure remains," the frail old man said. "Waiting. The Duce's legacy, buried in the mountains. Two hundred and fifty million euros that rightfully belongs to the movement."

Another of the younger men shifted in his seat. "We've spent a great deal of money over the years. Informants in Dongo, surveillance on the Fleischer family in Koblenz. And what have we gained? A handful of false alarms. Tourists with cameras. Academics writing books."

"The investment is modest compared to the potential return." This from the meeting leader, his tone brooking no argument. "Let me remind you all of what we know."

He stood, hands clasped behind his back, and began to pace.

"Mussolini had a chest of jewels with him when he fled Milan. This is documented—multiple witnesses, multiple sources. The chest was still with him when the convoy reached Dongo on April 27, 1945. He was traveling with his mistress, Clara Petacci, and a small escort of SS soldiers."

The lawyer nodded impatiently. Everyone at the table knew this.

"What is less well known," the leader continued, "is what happened in Dongo before the partisans arrived. According to our sources—sources we have cultivated for decades—the limousine carrying Mussolini stopped at a restaurant in the town square. Two SS men were driving. While the Duce and his mistress were in the washroom, the SS men stole his jacket, which contained the keys to the chest, and drove off into the mountains."

"And then the partisans attacked the car," the frail old man said. "We know this. One SS man was killed—a Hauptsturmführer named Paul Fleischer. His body was found in the wreck. But the partisans never found the chest. They never found the keys. And they never found the second soldier."

"The unknown man," one of the younger men said. "You've been searching for him for decades."

"We believe he buried the chest somewhere between Dongo and the location where the car was attacked. It cannot have been far—the chest weighs more than thirty kilograms, and the terrain is steep. He must have found a hiding place within a few hundred meters of the road."

"Unless he took the jewels out of the chest and carried them loose."

"Impossible. The chest is booby-trapped. Without both keys, turned simultaneously, any attempt to open it will trigger an explosion. The jewels are still inside—they have to be."

Silence fell over the room. The portrait of Mussolini stared down at them, frozen in its eternal salute.

"So we wait," the lawyer said finally. "We maintain our network of informants. We watch the Fleischer family. And we hope that someday, someone will lead us to the treasure."

"Not hope," the meeting leader said. "Patience. The second soldier—whoever he was—knew where he buried the chest. He may have told someone. A family member, a trusted friend. That information is out there, somewhere. And when someone acts on it, we will be ready."

"Ready to do what, exactly?"

The old man at the head of the table spoke, his voice like dry leaves. "Ready to reclaim what is rightfully ours. By whatever means necessary."

The words hung in the air.

"We have agreements with employees at every hotel and restaurant in the Dongo area," the leader said. "They watch for suspicious tourists—people who ask questions about Mussolini's escape, who seem interested in the mountains above the town, who behave as if they're searching for something. Any unusual activity is reported to this office immediately."

"And the Fleischer family?"

"The same. We have cultivated relationships with neighbors in their building. If a stranger contacts the family—if anyone shows interest in Paul Fleischer's wartime service—we will know within hours."

The lawyer drummed his fingers on the table. "This has been going on for decades. We've had perhaps four or five alerts in all that time, and they've all been false alarms. Historians, journalists, treasure hunters working from rumors. None of them knew anything."

"Which is precisely why we continue." The frail old man's voice was sharp. "We are waiting for the one person who does know. The second soldier, or his descendants. Someone with the keys, someone with a map. When they come—and they will come, eventually—we need to be ready."

"And if they never come?"

"Then the treasure remains where it is. Hidden. Forgotten. But it will not fall into the hands of the Italian state, or the Jews who claim reparations, or the academics who would put it in a museum. It will belong to no one—which is better than belonging to our enemies."

The meeting leader looked around the table. "Shall we vote?"

One by one, the men raised their hands. The decision was unanimous.

"Then we continue as before," the leader said. "Unchanged, undiminished. The network remains in place. The surveillance continues. And when the time comes, we act."

The frail old man smiled—a thin, cold expression that didn't reach his eyes.

"The treasure belongs to the movement," he said. "It was assembled by the Duce himself, from twenty years of building a new Rome. It is our inheritance. Our birthright. And we will have it, no matter how long we have to wait."

The meeting adjourned. The men rose, shook hands, exchanged quiet words. One by one, they filtered out through the courtyard gate and into the Roman afternoon, disappearing into the crowds of tourists and shoppers on the Via dei Coronari.

The palazzo fell silent.

In the meeting room, the portrait of Mussolini stared at the empty chairs, his arm still raised in salute.

Waiting.

Later that evening, the meeting leader sat alone in his private office, reviewing the accounts. The Dongo operation was expensive—bribes, informants, secure communications—but the organization could afford it. They had other sources of income, other investments. The treasure was a contingency, a long-shot bet that might never pay off.

But what a payoff it would be.

Two hundred and fifty million euros. Enough to fund operations for decades. Enough to make the movement a force again, not just a handful of old men meeting in secret rooms.

He thought about the unknown soldier—the man who had escaped with the chest, who had buried it somewhere in the mountains, who had vanished into the chaos of postwar Europe. Dead now, certainly. But he must have told someone. A son, a nephew, a trusted friend.

The information was out there. It had to be.

Somewhere, someone knew where Mussolini's treasure was buried.

And when that person came looking for it, the organization would be waiting.

The leader closed the ledger and turned off the desk lamp. The room fell into darkness, except for a sliver of light from the courtyard below.

He could be patient. They had waited seventy-five years.

They could wait a little longer.
