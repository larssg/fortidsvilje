The autobahn unrolled before them like a gray ribbon, three lanes wide, almost empty.

Ole had taken the wheel after Lübeck, easing into the rhythm of German driving—faster than anything he'd experienced, but somehow more controlled. The Porsche responded to every input like a living thing, eager to run.

"How fast?" Malene asked.

"One-sixty. Give or take."

"That's not fast. That's Sunday driving."

"It's fast enough for me."

They'd eaten lunch at a rest stop south of Hamburg—clean, efficient, the food surprisingly good. Nothing like the greasy disaster of the day before. German infrastructure, when it worked, worked well.

Now the landscape was changing. The flat northern plains giving way to hills, then ridges, the road rising and falling like a gentle roller coaster.

"I need to stretch my legs," Malene said. "And test the pistol. We never got a proper chance."

"Where?"

She pointed at the GPS. "There's a large forest coming up. We can pull off, find a quiet spot."

The forest road was narrow and winding, leading them deep into shadow. Pines crowded close on both sides, blocking the sun. After five minutes, Malene told him to stop.

"Perfect. No houses, no people. We can walk in from here."

They followed a trail uphill, the path soft with needles, the air thick with the smell of resin. After fifteen minutes, they emerged into a small clearing—fallen logs, wild grass, the ruins of what might have been a hunter's blind.

"This will do." Malene produced the Walther from her bag. "Watch."

She showed him the safety, the slide, the magazine release. Her hands were steady, confident. She'd clearly done this before.

"Where did you learn?" Ole asked.

"My father. He collects military antiques. I've been shooting since I was twelve."

She loaded the magazine, chambered a round, took aim at a rotting stump twenty meters away. The report was sharp and sudden, echoing off the trees. A chunk of wood exploded from the stump.

"Your turn."

Ole took the pistol. It felt heavier than he'd expected, more real. He mimicked her stance—legs spread, both hands on the grip—and squeezed the trigger.

Nothing happened.

"Safety," Malene said.

He flipped the lever and tried again. This time the gun kicked hard, the sound making his ears ring. He had no idea where the bullet went.

"Again. Don't jerk the trigger. Squeeze it."

He fired twice more. The second shot kicked up dirt near the stump. The third actually hit it.

"Better. Not good, but—"

Dogs.

The sound came from somewhere behind them—barking, excited, getting closer. Then voices, shouting in German.

"Go," Malene said. "Now."

They ran. Downhill, back the way they'd come, branches whipping at their faces. The barking grew louder, closer. Ole's lungs burned.

The car appeared through the trees. They threw themselves inside, and Ole had the engine running before his door was fully closed. Gravel sprayed as they shot down the forest road.

In the rearview mirror, he saw figures emerging from the treeline. Men with rifles. Hunters, probably. Angry hunters who'd heard gunshots in their territory.

"Don't stop," Malene said. "Just drive."

It took them thirty minutes to find their way back to the autobahn. By then, Ole's hands had stopped shaking—mostly.

"That was close," he said.

"That was stupid. We should have been more careful."

"Should we get rid of the gun?"

"No." Malene's voice was firm. "We might need it. We definitely might need it."

They drove in silence for a while. The speedometer crept up—180, 190, 200. Ole barely noticed. The car wanted to go fast, and for once, so did he.

"Pull off at the next rest area," Malene said. "I'll put the gun back under the seat. And Ole?"

"Yes?"

"Don't tell anyone about this. Ever."

Koblenz appeared in the late afternoon—a city at the confluence of two rivers, old and new buildings mixed together, the ruins of a medieval castle on the heights above.

Their hotel was a modern high-rise by the Rhine, twenty-five floors of glass and steel. The room was on the eighteenth floor, with a view that stretched for miles in every direction.

"You splurged," Malene said.

"We're on vacation. Sort of."

She explored the room while he opened a bottle of sparkling wine from the minibar. King-size bed. Sitting area. Marble bathroom with thick robes and complimentary toiletries.

"I could get used to this."

"That's the plan." He handed her a glass. "To the treasure. Whatever happens."

"To the treasure."

They drank. The wine was cold and sharp, exactly what they needed after the day's adventures.

"Tomorrow," Malene said. "Florinspfaffengasse. We find the Fleischer family."

"And if we can't find them?"

"Then we deal with that when it happens. But we try. We have to try."

The next morning, they walked through the old town.

It wasn't old, really—most of it had been rebuilt after the war, the medieval originals destroyed by Allied bombing. But the Germans had done their best to recreate what had been lost, and from a distance, it almost looked authentic.

Florinspfaffengasse was a narrow street connecting two churches—Florinkirche at one end, Liebfrauenkirche at the other. Maybe two hundred meters long, lined with apartment buildings and small shops.

They walked it twice, looking for a nameplate that said Fleischer.

Nothing.

"This isn't going to work," Ole said. "They might have moved. They might have died. They might never have lived here in the first place."

"We could ask around."

"Ask what? 'Excuse me, we're looking for the family of an SS soldier who died in 1945?' That won't attract attention at all."

Malene didn't answer. She was looking at the Catholic church at the end of the street, at an elderly woman who was sweeping the steps.

"Wait here," she said.

Ole watched her approach the woman, speak to her, gesture toward the street. The woman nodded, said something, pointed. Malene's posture changed—she leaned in, asked another question.

When she came back, she was smiling.

"Helga Jantzen. Third floor, number twelve. Paul Fleischer's niece. She's lived there her whole life."

Ole stared at her. "How did you—"

"I told her we were trying to thank a soldier who saved my boyfriend's relative during the war. She knew the family. She knew Paul." Malene took his arm. "Come on. Let's find the building."

Number twelve was a white three-story building near the Catholic church. The nameplate for the top floor read JANTZEN.

"Not today," Malene said. "We're not ready. We don't have anything to give her yet."

"But we know where she is."

"We know where she is." She squeezed his hand. "When we come back from Italy—if we find what we're looking for—we'll knock on that door. We'll keep the promise."

"You've changed your mind about sharing?"

"I've changed my mind about a lot of things." She looked at him steadily. "You were right. The promise matters. Even if the man who made it did terrible things. Maybe especially then."

They stood there for a moment, looking up at the building where Paul Fleischer's niece lived, where the diamonds from the mountains would eventually find their way.

"Italy tomorrow," Ole said.

"Italy tomorrow."

They walked back to the hotel, hand in hand, already thinking about what came next.

Behind them, unseen, a dark sedan idled at the curb. Two men watched them go, then pulled out their phones to report.

The targets were on schedule.

Everything was proceeding according to plan.
