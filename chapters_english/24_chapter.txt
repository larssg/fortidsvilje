Italy 2019


Russo sat on his balcony and enjoyed a cigarette while mentally reviewing what had happened over the last few days. The tasks the waiter and street sweeper were to carry out had been organized, so now it was really just a matter of waiting for the Danes to begin the treasure hunt in earnest.
Russo had followed the Danes' movements closely on the GPS and hadn't noticed anything that resembled anything other than what ordinary mountain hikers did. They had driven to various places in the mountains, where the car had stood still for a few hours before they returned to Dongo in the afternoon.
When he had finished smoking the cigarette, he went into the room to once again look at the GPS and make sure the Danes were now on their way back to the hotel.
The red dot blinked on the screen, but not as Russo expected on the way into Dongo, but rather near Como. Russo's heart began to pound heavily and he stared excitedly at the screen: "Were the Danes on their way further, and weren't they going on a treasure hunt after all?"
It was perhaps his worst nightmare that was unfolding before his eyes, without him being able to do the slightest thing about it. The Danes could easily have checked out in the morning before they left the hotel, and now they were on their way further down into Italy.
Russo paced back and forth in the room while his brain boiled with frustration and rage. Finally he pulled himself together and began to think rationally. It wasn't at all certain that the Danes had left Dongo. Perhaps they were just on an excursion to Como, which was also worth a visit.
Russo now took his phone and called the hotel reception, where he politely inquired whether the Danes were still staying at the hotel, which was confirmed.
Russo was now somewhat reassured but wondered what the Danes were doing in Como. Maybe he should have put physical surveillance on the Danes from the start after all. Now he wouldn't find out whether the Danes were just sightseeing or whether they had gone to meet someone.
Russo thought it was probably time he tried to charm his way into the Danes' confidence. Maybe he could get them to tell him a bit about what they had been doing in Como.
The screen showed that the car was standing still on the outskirts of Como and after a while began to move northward again toward Dongo. Russo breathed a sigh of relief; the Danes were on their way back into the trap that had been set for them, and Russo's plans for the future were realistic again.
After an hour of waiting, Russo could see that the Porsche was now approaching Dongo again, and he therefore went out on the balcony to shortly afterward see the car park below the hotel.
When the Danes got out of the car, Russo could see that they were each carrying a flat cardboard box. That was probably what they had taken the trip to Como to buy. Russo couldn't see exactly what was in the boxes, but it looked like screens, so Russo assumed it was probably some kind of computer equipment they had bought.
Russo couldn't imagine what the Danes would need computer equipment for, but of course they might need some entertainment to pass the time in the room when they weren't out hiking in the mountains.


Russo instructed the waiter to notify him if the Danes left the hotel, and early in the evening Russo's phone rang with news that they had gone for a walk northward along the lake.
Russo hurried down to the lake to perhaps be able to catch up with the Danes, but they were already too far away for him to call out to them. Russo therefore went to a beach bar that lay a couple of hundred meters further north right down by the lakeside. He hoped the Danes had booked a table at the hotel or another restaurant in the center, so he could catch them when they returned from their walk. He would wave them over to his table, order a couple of drinks, and hopefully get a good conversation going.
Once the Danes got a little alcohol in them, they would surely start talking. Russo's experience was that alcohol was by far the best way to get people to talk; sometimes even about things they would have preferred to keep to themselves.
After Russo had sat for about half an hour, he could see the Danes in the distance, and when they were close enough, he waved them over to his table. At first they hesitated a bit but then sat down smiling and accepted the offer of a drink before dinner.
Conversation quickly got going about this and that. Russo told a story about working in the fashion industry as a fabric wholesaler, and the Danes eagerly told about what they had experienced on their trips in the mountains.
When the first drink was finished, the Danes accepted another, and they now sat for another half hour talking, during which the Danes told Russo that they had been in Como that same day to buy iPads.
Russo now asked with interest what they needed iPads for on a hiking holiday, and they told him that the equipment was partly to be used for playing games, but also for studying the mountains closely and perhaps finding paths that hadn't been used for a long time and were therefore hard to find.
Russo had to silently admit that the Danes' explanation made good sense. However, he was sure it wasn't forgotten paths they were looking for, but rather landmarks in the landscape they needed to find the treasure.
After talking for a few more minutes, the Danes excused themselves, thanked him for the drinks and good company, and walked hand in hand toward the hotel. Russo sat for a while thinking about what he had learned during the conversation. There was no doubt that the Danes really had hiked in the mountains like completely ordinary tourists, but Russo was convinced that they would now start looking for the treasure, since they had bought equipment that could help them examine the mountains more closely.
Russo decided that if the Danes drove toward Garzeno again the next day, he would activate the waiter and street sweeper so they could be sure to surprise the Danes the moment they found the treasure.


The next morning Russo sat on the balcony as usual, ready and keeping an eye on the Porsche. He had already been up for a long time and had both had breakfast and taken his usual walk along the water.
The evening before he had spoken with both the waiter and the street sweeper and ordered them to be ready to head up into the mountains at short notice. The waiter had acquired an old worn Fiat that they could drive when the time came. The car looked just like all the other old cars driving around in the mountains and wouldn't arouse suspicion.
After Russo had been on guard for about half an hour, the Danes came out of the hotel, got into the car, and drove north out of town. Russo hurried into the room to keep an eye on the GPS, and to his delight he saw that the car was taking the same route as the day before.
This time, however, the Danes didn't drive into Garzeno but drove around it and further up into the mountains until they finally stopped a short distance past a place where the road divided.
Russo's heart almost stopped from sheer excitement. He was sure the Danes were now seriously beginning the treasure hunt, and that the place where the car was parked must be close to where they would search.
Russo immediately got hold of the waiter and called him up to the room: "You must leave immediately. I think the Danes are starting to look for the treasure in earnest now, so there's no time to waste."
"Where are they now?"
"Look here at the GPS, the dot shows where the car is parked." Russo showed the waiter the screen and found a map showing the mountains around Dongo.
"Now I'll put a cross here on the map so you can find it. Remember to be discreet. They mustn't become suspicious of you."
"We'll just drive past the place where they're parked and find a spot to stop further up the road. Then we can sneak up on them on foot from above."
"OK, that sounds like a good plan. See if you can find some different clothes than what you usually wear. They shouldn't recognize you."
"I'll find some clothes. We have quite a lot of clothes here at the hotel that guests have left behind over time. I think I'll also take a couple of caps to hide our faces."
"Good idea, but hurry up and get going. I've told the hotel here not to count on you for the next few days."
The waiter hurried to fold up the map and get out of the room, and shortly afterward Russo could see the old Fiat drive past the hotel on its way toward Garzeno.
Russo now kept almost constant watch on the red dot on the screen. It was almost unbearable just to sit passively in a chair. He would have loved to be up on the mountain, but he had gotten too old to sneak through the scrub on steep slopes. He would only have been a nuisance and a risk of the Danes discovering them if he fell and got hurt.
Finally, after several hours, the car began to move down toward Dongo again. Russo looked forward to hearing what the waiter and street sweeper had observed during the day. Hopefully they had seen something that could point to where the treasure was buried and perhaps something that showed whether the Danes were already close to finding the right place.


After a couple of hours of impatient waiting, there was a knock on the door, and the waiter came into the room.
Russo asked impatiently: "Well, let me hear what you saw today."
The waiter stood almost at attention and replied: "We saw the Danes' car parked where you had put the cross, and as we agreed, we drove a bit further up the mountain to hide the car. Then we sneaked down until we could hear the Danes' voices."
"What were they doing then?"
"At first it actually looked a bit aimless. They walked back and forth in the scrub for a long time as if they were looking for something, but finally they concentrated on a smaller area where they tried to clear some of the scrub with a spade they had brought from the car."
"Were they already digging for the treasure?" Russo's voice trembled with excitement.
"I don't think so. It seemed more like they needed to uncover some kind of landmark."
"Strange. Did you find out what it was they had been working on?"
"Yes, when the Danes left the place, we saw that they had found the foundation of an old house that had almost completely disappeared. They were lucky to find it, because it had almost completely merged with the ground."
"They must need the foundation for something, since they're making so much effort to find it and dig it free." Russo looked questioningly at the waiter.
"Yes, but they didn't do anything more after they had uncovered the foundation. I think they were tired from the hard work in the heat. Maybe we'll know more tomorrow."
"Yes, maybe." Russo walked around the room a bit while he thought. "Tomorrow you drive up to the same place as today. The Danes usually leave here around nine, so you leave at seven. That way we're sure you're in place when the Danes arrive. They shouldn't be able to do anything without us knowing."
"OK, we'll be ready."
"Good. Make sure to bring provisions. You won't have time to go get anything. I think the Danes are close to finding the treasure, so they'll probably work for a long time tomorrow."
"I'll take care of that, I'll just bring something from the hotel."
"Good. I want you to check the house where we'll be staying this evening. We may need it quickly."
"I'll get started right away."
The waiter left the room, and after sitting for a while, Russo took his hat and his cane and went out of the hotel to take his afternoon walk along the water. He needed to gather his thoughts after everything the waiter had told him. There was no doubt that they were now close to the end of their years of waiting. Things just had to be done right over the next few days, and he would be able to return to Rome in triumph as the movement's savior, and as long as he lived, there would be no one who dared challenge his leadership.
His task right now was to activate the team that would clean up when it was all over. They would need to be able to move in immediately and remove the bodies of the Danes, the waiter, and the street sweeper, while at the same time making sure all traces of what had happened were wiped away.
Russo had no qualms about having to kill four people. He had killed several times before without it bothering him much, so he was ready to do it again.
