Copenhagen/Funen, April 2019


At exactly 10 o'clock, Ole stood in the departure hall of the Central Station waiting for Malene, who shortly afterward came walking toward him with brisk steps. Ole was close to giving her a kiss as a greeting but caught himself and settled for giving her a light hug. Old habits had almost gotten the better of him.
Ole said: "Do you have the seat reservations?"
"Yes, of course," said Malene. "Now we just need to check in with the travel card, and we're on our way."
"Great, it should be an exciting day. It's not every day you pick up a sports car you didn't know you owned."
"No, not many people have experienced that. I noticed you haven't posted anything on Facebook about the trip we're taking. Don't you think it should be shared with others?"
Ole said: "No, I don't use Facebook much anymore, and I can easily imagine all the requests I would get to borrow the car for various events like confirmations and weddings. It's probably best that it remains a secret for now. I also have no idea what condition the car is in—maybe it's a wreck that's ready to be scrapped."
"If your father spent money on having the car stored for the winter, it's probably in excellent condition," said Malene. "Besides, old Porsches don't get scrapped. They get renovated for a lot of money so they're completely like new again, but it will be exciting to see what condition your father's Porsche is in."
The sunshine was lovely, so for the rest of the trip, they sat chatting and enjoying the journey across Zealand and through the tunnel to Funen.
When they arrived in Odense, there was half an hour until the local train to Middelfart was due to leave, so Ole suggested they find a place where they could get something to eat. They quickly found a sandwich bar where they could satisfy their hunger. When they had finished eating, they went down to the platform to wait for the train.
When they were shortly afterward sitting in the small local train, which consisted of only two cars, Malene said: "You'd better call the scrap dealer. It only takes 20 minutes to get to Aarup, I can see from the timetable."
"OK," said Ole and called Arne. Ole got through to Arne and arranged to meet outside the station. They could easily find the car, Arne had said, because he was the only one on Funen who drove around in an old Cadillac convertible.
Sure enough. When they came out to the station square, there stood a huge black American car with the top down. Next to the car stood a large, burly middle-aged man who smiled and extended his hand in greeting as they walked toward him.
"Welcome to Aarup," said Arne. "Please take a seat in the limousine. Hop in the back seat and you'll be transported in style. You don't need to worry about drafts. First of all, most of the wind doesn't reach down into the cabin, and I never drive very fast in this car."
Malene and Ole sat down in the back seat on the soft leather seats and enjoyed the ride through the small town in the nice weather. When they were out of town, Arne picked up the speed a bit, but it was still pleasant to sit and look out at the gentle Funen landscape.
Ole said: "We're experiencing something new today. I've never ridden in an American car before, and soon we'll be driving in a sports car—that's also new for me."
"It's new for me too," said Malene, "but you could easily get addicted to being transported in a Cadillac. It almost feels like floating above the ground."
Arne said: "That's because the suspension in the old American cars is much softer than in European cars. It may not give such good handling, but in return it's super comfortable."
"That's why it looks so wild when you see a car chase in old American movies," said Ole. "The cars lean so much it looks like they're about to tip over."
Arne said: "Yes, car chases aren't exactly a specialty of American cars. They're best driven gently—that's what they prefer."
Shortly afterward, they reached the scrap yard, where a sign hung over the entrance with the text: "Aarup Auto Salvage by Arne Dahl." Arne turned into the driveway and stopped in front of a low building with the sign "Office. Open all weekdays 8-17."
They got out of the car and Arne waved them into the office.
"We just need to take care of the financials," said Arne, "then we'll get the Porsche out afterward."
The office was clearly a room that served many purposes. It was apparently an office, kitchen, and canteen all in one. There was a desk, a dining table, a refrigerator, a sink, and a coffee machine. Against one wall stood a sofa that looked well-used and had surely been used for many afternoon naps.
On the desk there was already an invoice, which Arne handed to Ole. The invoice consisted of many lines, all with an amount, and in total the invoice came to 5,000 kroner. Ole looked at the invoice in puzzlement and then said to Arne: "What does all this cover? Wasn't the car just supposed to have a place to stand over the winter?"
Arne said: "A car that's going to sit still for more than six months needs to be prepared both before storage and after, otherwise it will be damaged. The car has had an oil change and we've had it up on blocks so the tires wouldn't be ruined. The car was also thoroughly washed and waxed before it was put on blocks. It also costs money to keep the hall heated so the cars don't get moisture damage."
Ole was still sure that Arne was somehow ripping him off, but he couldn't figure out how, so he took out his debit card and ran it through the terminal that Arne had already prepared.
When the financials were taken care of, Arne went over to a key board that hung on the wall next to the door. There was room for about 30 keys, but only one set now hung there.
Arne said: "Yes, as you can see, all the other cars have been picked up long ago. It's only the Porsche that's still in the hall. We use the hall to prepare go-karts in the summer when there are races. It's my son and a couple of his friends who are into the sport."
Arne went outside, and Malene and Ole followed him to a larger hall clad with steel plates. Arne took a key out of his pocket and removed a padlock that locked the gate. Arne pulled on one of the gate doors, which opened with a loud creak.
Inside, the hall seemed warm and dry, and the concrete floor was swept and without a trace of dirt. It was clear that the cars were well cared for here. When they had gotten used to the twilight, they could see a car that stood somewhat lonely in one corner. Ole immediately recognized the profile of a Porsche 911, and his heart immediately began to beat faster at the thought that the car was his and that he would soon try to drive it himself. The car was sparkling clean, and it was clear that it had been given a thorough polishing. Maybe Arne was an honest man after all who just wanted to be paid for his work, Ole thought as they walked toward the car.
Ole said: "Do you know what model it is, Arne?"
"It's a Porsche 911 3.6 Carrera from 1990," said Arne. "It's a very well-maintained car that has never been driven in winter, and as far as I remember, it's only done about 100,000 kilometers."
Malene said: "That wasn't much. It must have been off the road for long periods if it's done so little in 29 years."
"I don't know the car's history completely," said Arne, "but many cars like this are bought for speculation purposes, and then they're just stored somewhere until the price has risen enough that the owner is willing to sell."
Ole said: "Do you know how long my father had the car?"
"He had it for exactly 4 years," said Arne. "I know because I helped him find it in Germany myself and get it registered here in Denmark. If you're not planning to drive it, I can sell it for you at a good price. It's a very well-maintained example, so it's easy to sell."
Ole thought for a moment and said: "I'm definitely planning to keep the car through the summer, but what do you think it's worth?"
"If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's worth about 800,000," said Arne, "maybe even more on a good day."
Ole said, astonished: "I had no idea my father would spend that kind of money on a car! We've always had quite ordinary family cars like Opel Kadett and VW Passat."
"When your father came to me, he said he had always dreamed of owning a sports car, and now it had to happen if he was going to do it before he got too old," said Arne.
Ole and Malene walked around the car and admired the beautiful lines and the shiny black paint. It was a very beautiful and well-maintained car, and Ole couldn't believe it was now his. Malene opened the door on the driver's side and sat down in the firm sports leather seat. She had a smile on her lips that clearly showed she felt very comfortable.
Arne said: "Do you want to drive the car out of the hall?"
"No," said Malene, "you'd better do that, but I'm going to drive the car to Copenhagen. Ole doesn't have much experience driving."
Arne said: "OK, then I'll drive the car out for you. A Porsche isn't hard to drive, actually. They behave like regular cars, just much faster. This model also has both ABS and power steering, so it's not a big problem to drive it. You can actually easily use the car as a daily means of transport—it can handle that."
Malene got out of the car and handed over the wheel to Arne, who turned the key and started the engine. Immediately the hall was filled with a deep rumble, and it was easy to hear that it was a large and powerful engine that had started. Arne gave it a little gas and slowly rolled out of the hall.
Arne stopped the car in the yard in front of the hall, let the car idle, and got out. Addressing Malene, he said: "Now you're ready to drive. You can just get in. We've filled it up with gas and checked it over, so there shouldn't be any problems. Remember that the engine is in the back and the trunk is in the front. It's the opposite of what you're used to these days."
"I can see there are also back seats. I didn't think sports cars had those," said Ole.
Arne said: "That's mostly for show, I think. You can squeeze a couple of smaller children in, but that's about it. You can use the back seats for luggage instead. I think that's what most people do."
Ole and Malene shook hands with Arne in farewell and got into the car—Ole in the passenger seat and Malene in the driver's seat. Malene put the Porsche in gear, gave a little bit of gas, and carefully released the clutch. The car rolled very slowly out of the scrap yard, and when they got out onto the country road, Malene gave a little more gas and gradually got the speed up to 60.
Ole sat in the passenger seat and enjoyed the ride. They went at a sedate pace toward Aarup again. Maybe driving a sports car wasn't so scary after all, he thought. The only things that seemed different from the cars he was used to riding in were that they sat very low and that there was constantly a deep rumble from the engine in the back. It was clear to hear that the engine could do much more than it was being allowed to do now.
Malene said: "I don't know the car, so I'm rolling along quite carefully into Aarup. I remember there were some signs to the motorway in town. Once we're on the motorway, we'll easily find our way home."
"Otherwise we can just start navigation on one of our phones," said Ole.
"Yes," said Malene, "but let's see if we can find our way home without it. It's incredibly annoying to listen to instructions all the time. We can wait to start the navigation until we reach Copenhagen. We need to find the garage on Heimdalsgade."
The trip to Copenhagen went without problems. The weather was lovely, and they just followed the traffic across Funen, the Great Belt, and Zealand. They noticed that many fellow motorists looked admiringly at the Porsche and had to get close to take a better look at the beautiful car. At one point when they had gotten clear of an overtaking truck and the road lay open in front of them, Malene tried giving a little extra gas and immediately the car sprang forward with an angry roar from the engine.
Ole felt as if someone was pressing him on the chest and pushing him forcefully back into the seat.
Ole said: "Easy now, Malene. We'd like to get there in one piece, and preferably without getting a speeding ticket too."
"I just accelerated up to the 130 we're allowed to drive here," said Malene, "and besides, the car is built to go really fast. We should at least try to feel a bit of what it can do—otherwise we might as well have driven an old clunker with 50 horsepower. Don't you want to try driving the car yourself?"
Ole said: "No, it's fine that you drive it home. I don't really dare drive on the motorway. There are too many cars, and it's going too fast. We can maybe go for a couple of drives next week. Then I can take over the wheel sometimes and try what it's like to drive the car."
"We'll figure that out, but I probably won't have time until next weekend," said Malene. "We also need to start planning the trip to Italy. There are only a couple of months until we get summer vacation. I think I'll book a hotel tonight, so it's done. How long do you think we'll need to find the treasure?"
Ole said: "I really have no idea, but we'd better allow plenty of time. If you book two weeks, that should be enough. If we can't find the chest in a couple of weeks, it's probably impossible to get our hands on."
"Then I'll book a couple of weeks in the middle of July," said Malene. "Does it seem suspicious that we're booking such a long time, do you think?"
Ole said: "I don't think so. It's not unusual to take a two-week vacation in the same place."
When they had dropped off the car at the garage in Nørrebro, they said goodbye to each other and agreed to meet the following Saturday, when they would both start planning the trip to Italy and take a drive in the Porsche.
