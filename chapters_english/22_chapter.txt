CHAPTER 22

GERMANY
1947-1950


The train crawled through the ruins of Munich at sunset, smoke rising from a hundred reconstruction sites, cranes swinging against the orange sky.

Jens stood on the rear platform with Udo, smoking, watching the devastation unfold.

"It looks worse than I imagined," Udo said.

"It looks like the end of the world."

"The end of one world, maybe. The beginning of another."

The train stopped. Prisoners disembarked, milling on the platform, awaiting instructions. Guards were scarce—they weren't really prisoners anymore, just displaced persons in transit.

"This is where I leave you," Jens said.

"The toilets?"

"The toilets. If anyone asks, I'm accompanying the Norwegians."

Udo gripped his hand. "Volkmarsen. Dieter Schmidt. I'll find you."

"Give it time. A year, maybe two."

"I'll wait."

They shook hands—two men who'd survived everything together, now going their separate ways.

Then Jens grabbed his duffel bag and walked toward the end of the platform, where a cluster of prisoners was heading for the facilities. He fell in with them, matched their pace, and when they rounded the corner of the station building, he kept walking.

Into the ruined city.

Into his new life.


He slept in a bombed-out building that first night, curled in a corner with his bag under his head, the diamonds pressing against his chest through the jacket lining.

The next morning, he started walking.

He could have gone directly to Volkmarsen—the soldier Arno Wittel had promised help if he ever needed it. But something made him hesitate. The chaos of postwar Germany was an opportunity. In this rubble, a man could reinvent himself. Build something new from the ground up.

He was passing through a residential area when an old man called out to him.

"Young man! Help me with this cart?"

Jens turned. The man was struggling with a handcart piled high with cleaned bricks—salvage from the ruins, material for rebuilding. The load was far too heavy for him.

Jens could have walked on. Instead, he grabbed the handles.

"Where are we going?"

The old man smiled. "Not far. And there's dinner in it for you."


His name was Hans Werlinder. Seventy-two years old. A goldsmith before the war, with a shop on one of Munich's finest streets. He'd lost his wife and daughter in the bombing, his business to looters, his home to fire.

All he had left was a half-destroyed building and the determination to rebuild it.

"I need help," Hans said over a meal of bread and sausage. "Manual labor, construction work. I can offer room and board, a small wage. Nothing fancy, but steady."

Jens thought about it for perhaps thirty seconds.

"I'll stay."


The months that followed were the most peaceful of his life.

He worked alongside Hans, clearing rubble, hauling materials, learning the basics of bricklaying and carpentry. The physical labor was exhausting but satisfying—creating something instead of destroying, building instead of burning.

He went by Dieter Schmidt. The story he'd crafted with Udo held up perfectly: a dock worker from Hamburg, family killed in the bombing, no home to return to. In postwar Germany, such stories were common. No one questioned them.

The diamonds stayed hidden, sewn into the lining of his jacket, locked in a trunk under his bed. A fortune waiting to be used. But not yet. Not until the time was right.


In the spring of 1948, a letter arrived from Kiel.

Udo had found him through the Red Cross missing persons service—a remarkable piece of detective work in the chaos of divided Germany. The letter was brief: the family business was recovering. Coffee imports were resuming. Capital was needed.

Jens wrote back: Give me another year.

He wasn't ready. The new identity felt comfortable now, like a well-worn coat. But it was still fragile. One wrong question, one suspicious official, and everything could unravel.

Better to wait. Better to be certain.


In the spring of 1950, another letter arrived.

This one was urgent. The business was growing faster than expected. Scandinavian markets were opening. Real capital was needed now—serious money, the kind Jens had hinted he might be able to provide.

Jens read the letter twice, then went to find Hans.


"I need to ask you something."

They were in the kitchen, the evening meal finished, the reconstruction of the house almost complete. Three years of work, and the building was nearly livable again.

"Ask."

Jens reached into his pocket and produced two diamonds. They caught the lamplight and threw it back in fragments.

Hans went very still.

"I need to sell these," Jens said. "And I need to know they're worth what I think they're worth."

Hans picked up the stones, examined them with a goldsmith's loupe, turned them in the light. His hands were steady, his expression neutral.

"These are exceptional," he said finally. "Large, clear, almost flawless. Where did you get them?"

"During the war. I didn't kill anyone for them."

Hans nodded slowly. "I'll buy them. Cash, American dollars. You'll get a fair price."

"I trust you."

"You should." Hans set down the loupe. "When do you need the money?"

"A week."

"You'll have it."


The transaction was simple. Hans produced a small fortune in American currency—money he'd hidden before the war, before the looters came. Jens handed over the diamonds and counted the bills twice.

It was enough. More than enough to give Udo the capital he needed, with plenty left over for emergencies.

"You're leaving," Hans said. It wasn't a question.

"Kiel. A friend has a business opportunity."

"Will you come back?"

Jens thought about it. He'd been happy here, or something close to happy. The work, the routine, the simple satisfaction of creation. It was more than he'd expected to find after everything he'd done.

"I don't know," he said honestly. "If things don't work out in Kiel..."

"There's always a place for you here."

They shook hands. Jens packed his bag, added the money in a hidden compartment, and caught the train north.


Kiel was rebuilding too, but differently—faster, more modern, the old medieval city giving way to something new and practical.

Udo met him at the station. He looked prosperous, well-fed, wearing a suit that would have been unthinkable two years ago.

"Dieter Schmidt," he said, grinning. "Welcome to the future."

They went to Udo's office—a real office now, with clerks and typewriters and telephones—and Jens handed over the money.

Udo counted it and whistled. "Where the hell did you get this?"

"Does it matter?"

"No." Udo locked the money in a safe. "No, I suppose it doesn't."

They spent the evening planning. Coffee imports from South America. Distribution networks through Scandinavia. A legitimate business built on stolen diamonds, two former SS soldiers becoming respectable merchants.

The irony wasn't lost on either of them.

"Partners," Udo said, raising his glass.

"Partners."

They drank. Outside, the lights of Kiel glittered on the dark water of the harbor.

The war was over. The future was beginning.

And somewhere in the Italian mountains, a chest full of diamonds waited in the darkness, patient as stone.
