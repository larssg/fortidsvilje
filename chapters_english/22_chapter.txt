Italy/Germany 1947/1948


The train crawled through Northern Italy and Austria, finally coming to a stop late in the evening at the station in Munich. Udo and Jens stood on the platform at the rear of the train smoking while looking out at the city, which was clearly marked by the bombardments from the war.
At the same time, however, there were many signs that reconstruction was in full swing in many places. The roads had been cleared, the rubble stacked, and in many places also cleaned of mortar so it could be used for building again. Several houses were surrounded by large scaffolding where craftsmen were busy repairing what the war had destroyed.
The trams apparently ran unhindered, and there were many cranes and excavators at work. Jens threw away his cigarette butt and said: "It looks like they're making good progress with rebuilding, even though it almost seems like an impossible task with all that's been destroyed."
Udo replied while studying a crane that was lifting building materials up onto some scaffolding: "Yes, it looks good, if only they're working the same way everywhere in Germany, we'll soon be back on our feet."
"Well, let's see, but it looks better than I thought. It might not be certain we'll have to wait so long to start the company. If there's work to be had and money to be made, people will quickly start demanding a bit of luxury."
"That's right, it doesn't take much before people want to indulge themselves a bit, but let's go through your story one more time so we're sure you know it by heart. Try to tell me who you are, where you come from, and a bit about your family history."
"My name is Dieter Schmidt, and I come from Flensburg. My whole family died during a bombardment, and I have nothing to return to. Until I became a soldier, I worked as a clerk at various small companies in Schleswig-Holstein. I've decided not to return to my home area, as it holds too many sad memories. I'd rather try to build a life somewhere else in Germany, where I don't constantly have to deal with the past."
Udo looked at Jens with satisfaction and said: "I think that sounds good. Probably smart to choose Flensburg as your hometown too. That can explain the faint Danish accent you still have. We just have to hope you don't run into someone who knows the city or comes from there."
"If that should happen, I'll just pretend I can't bear to talk about it."
"Yes, that should be able to fend off the most intrusive questions. Now we just need to arrange your escape from this train. How do you plan for that to happen?"
Jens thought for a moment and then said: "As far as I understand, this train continues all the way to Hamburg, and you'll be dropped off along the way where it best fits with where your hometown is. I, along with a couple of Norwegians who are also on the train, will then be escorted to the Danish border, where we'll be handed over to the Danish authorities. My task right now is to disappear somewhere between Munich and Hamburg."
Udo looked impatiently at Jens: "I'm well aware of all that, but how will you disappear? You'll have to have a plan, otherwise you'll end up in Flensburg before you know it, and then it will be too late."
Jens seemed to light up and said eagerly: "I actually think I'll try to get away already here in Munich. We're probably going to get provisions before long, and with the very few guards on this trip, it shouldn't be so hard to slip away unseen."
Jens looked at the station building and continued: "I can see that the urinal is all the way down at the other end of the building. If I go down to take a piss, and you cover for me a bit, I should be able to slip around the corner without being seen."
"That's quite a simple plan, but it should actually work, I think. If we just get a few more prisoners to cover for you, you should be fairly certain of being able to get away."
"I'll have to take my duffel bag out with me, how should I explain that?"
Udo thought for a moment: "If anyone asks, you can just say you want to go and accompany the two Norwegians who are also on the train. That's a very good explanation. You speak almost the same language, as far as I understand."
Jens smiled: "Excellent. Then that plan seems to be in place."
Jens looked down at himself and suddenly became concerned: "What about the clothes? If everyone can see that I'm an escaped prisoner, I won't get far."
"Your clothes aren't any different from what the rest of us are wearing. I'm also sure that many still use their uniforms even now that they're civilians. There's no money for anything else. In fact, the clothes we've been given in the camp don't really look like a uniform at all. It looks more like work clothes, I think."
They left the platform and went into the train car, where they let a few people in on Jens's escape plan. Four quickly volunteered to help, and when they were shortly afterward called out of the cars, they walked together while covering for Jens, who held his duffel bag so low that it wasn't visible to the guards.
There was already a stream of prisoners heading down toward the urinal, so the small group just followed along until they came all the way down to the corner of the building, where they positioned themselves so Jens could slip around the corner without being seen.
There were no guards on the other side of the station building, so Jens just walked calmly down a large boulevard that quickly led him away from the prisoner train.


Jens was now completely alone in the world. There was no one but Udo who knew that he was currently in Munich. He was a bit annoyed that he hadn't made sure to get some food before he escaped. It was now many hours since he had last eaten, and he was actually getting quite hungry.
It was perhaps a somewhat hasty decision he had made to escape already in Munich. He could have gotten much closer to Volkmarsen if he had stayed on the train a bit longer. On the other hand, his escape had succeeded, and it wasn't certain that he would later have gotten an equally good chance to get away from the train.
While he walked in his own thoughts, he spotted an elderly man coming along pulling a cart full of cleaned bricks. The cart was clearly far too heavy for the man to pull, and it was only going forward very slowly.
Jens walked briskly and was quickly past the elderly man, but suddenly he was called out to: "Hey young man. Could you give an old man a hand? I can hardly pull this cart here where it's going slightly uphill. We don't have far to go, and you can get a bit of food as thanks for your help."
Jens didn't hesitate but threw his duffel bag up on the load and took hold of the handles and began to pull, while the man went around to push from behind the cart.
Even for a young man like Jens, the cart was very heavy to pull, and he hoped they really didn't have far to go. After they had walked for about half an hour, Jens's whole body ached, and he was seriously regretting that he hadn't just walked on when the old man called out to him.
Just as Jens was about to give up, the man shouted: "Stop, we're here. Just pull the cart over to the wall here. That's fine."
Jens now saw that they were in front of a narrow house that had previously been four stories but was now reduced to two, of which the lowest was an empty shop space without windows.
Jens stood for a bit catching his breath after the exertion, while looking up at the house. He could see that a flimsy scaffold had been erected up the wall, and that some brickwork had already been done on top of the first floor. Jens said: "Is it you who's doing the bricklaying here?"
The man replied while waving Jens toward the entrance door: "I can't do brickwork myself, but I own the house, and I'm trying to get the materials that the craftsmen need to rebuild the house. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to get both craftsmen and materials, so the rebuilding is only progressing slowly."
They now went up the stairs and into the apartment on the first floor. The man showed Jens into a small kitchen where there was a dining area with room for two.
The man pointed to one of the chairs and said: "Sit down, and I'll get some food out. If you haven't eaten yet, you must be hungry at this time of day."
Jens sat down and watched while the man set the table for a modest meal of bread and some cold meat. They now ate in silence for a while. When they were almost full, the man said: "Thank you for the help with the cart. I wouldn't have managed it without help. I'm afraid I overestimated my strength. But what's your name, and where do you come from?"
Jens replied: "My name is Dieter Schmidt, and I've just been released from a prison camp in Italy, where I've been for the last two years."
The man now wanted to know where Jens was heading and where he came from. Jens told the story he had made up with Udo, and that he was now on his way to Volkmarsen to see if he could get lodging and work, as he had been promised.
The man sat thinking for a while before he said: "You can have lodging and work here with me, if you want. I can't offer you much in wages, but you can have food and a bed to sleep in."
"What would I be working with," said Jens, a bit surprised by the man's quick offer.
"There's plenty to do on the house. Much of what was destroyed needs to be carted away before the craftsmen can really get started. You'll also need to fetch building materials and work as a bricklayer's assistant. You certainly won't be bored."
Jens thought about the man's offer, which he was quickly tempted by. It would actually be nice if he had a fixed base in the first time in freedom. If he settled in Munich for a period, he could calm the situation down and arrange the trip to Volkmarsen when he was ready for it.
Jens accepted the man's offer, and he was now shown down a long hallway, where the man unlocked the door to a small room where there was a bed as well as a desk, a chair, a small wardrobe, and a washstand.
The old man said: "Unpack your duffel bag, and I'll bring some bedding for you. When you're ready, come back down to me in the kitchen, so we can talk about what you'll be starting on tomorrow."


When Jens had settled into the room, he went back down to the kitchen, where he had a long talk with the old man. It turned out that the man was seventy-two years old and had lived in the house his whole life. He had inherited the house from his parents and worked as a goldsmith in his shop, which had been housed on the ground floor.
The man's name was Hans Werlinder, and he was now alone after both his wife and a daughter had perished in one of the bombardments. He still had hope of getting a son home alive from the war, but the son had been reported missing on the Eastern Front already two years before the war ended, so the chance of seeing him alive again was not great.
The property they now sat in the ruins of had previously been on one of Munich's finest shopping streets, and the goldsmith shop supplied jewelry to all the wealthy businessmen in the city.
The business had been booming until the fortunes of war turned and there became a shortage of more or less everything. It had gone completely wrong during a bombardment that had removed the top floors of the property and had smashed the protection the shop had over its windows.
When Hans Werlinder and his family came up from the shelter, the shop had been completely looted. Even a large safe that had stood in a back room had been removed, and all the fixtures were destroyed.
Shortly afterward, Hans lost his family when they didn't reach safety quickly enough the next time the city was bombed.
Hans now had nothing to live for except the hope that his son would come home alive, and he had therefore started rebuilding the house so there would be something for his son to come home to. The work on the house filled all his waking hours and prevented him from sinking completely into despair.
Hans had no plans to reopen the goldsmith shop. He would rebuild the house and live off the income he could get from renting out the apartments and the shop.


Jens now worked together with Hans to rebuild the house. As promised, he received room and board and a modest wage, most of which he saved.
The money he spent was spent on a trip to the pub now and then with the craftsmen he gradually came to know. He hadn't been in bed with a woman for many years, so he also paid a couple of times for a prostitute whom he could take up to his room via the back stairs. Not because he thought Hans would take offense at him buying sex, but Jens still wanted to be discreet about it.
He found the women around the city, where they offered themselves in large numbers especially to the American soldiers, who were almost the only ones who had money. For many women, prostitution was the only way they could put food on the table for themselves and their children, after the men had disappeared in the maelstrom of war.
As the months passed, Jens began to consider staying in Munich instead of going to Volkmarsen. He had a good place to live, and the reconstruction of the house would secure him work for several years to come. Eventually he would probably also get a social circle or perhaps even friends.
It would also be easy to start a family if that was what he wanted. The city was teeming with widows, all of whom were looking for their next husband, and he had already chatted a bit with a couple of them who lived nearby.
After the hard and nomadic life he had lived for the past many years, it was tempting to settle down permanently and just calm down with a daily routine that demanded nothing more of him than work and rest. In the long run, it would of course probably become boring, but his need right now was not for a life with many changes.
If he stayed in Munich, it would be difficult to keep the agreement with Udo, who was supposed to look for him in Volkmarsen, but that could probably be solved somehow.
After weighing the pros and cons for a couple of days, Jens decided to stay in Munich. It was the easiest and safest thing for him. It was also impossible to know if the soldier from Volkmarsen would keep his promise to help him. After all, a couple of years had now passed since they met by Lake Como. Much could have happened in the soldier's life, and he might not want to be reminded of promises he had made to an almost stranger in the final turbulent times of the war.


In all the major cities in Germany, Red Cross offices had been set up where one could search for family and friends. The office in Munich was located in a part of the old town hall that had come through the war relatively unscathed.
One day when Jens was finished with work, he went down to the town hall and stood in line to search for Udo. If he got Udo's address, he could write to him and thus reestablish contact.
The line was long and moved only slowly, but finally it was Jens's turn to present his errand, and he was now led into a large room that was divided into cubicles where Red Cross workers sat behind small tables.
Jens was shown to an older, stern-looking woman. She sat with a form in front of her, which she filled out while asking Jens sharply and precisely about who he was looking for and what information he could give that could help in the search.
When the form was filled out, Jens was told to look at the notice board outside for an answer. If they succeeded in finding Udo, the information would be posted on the board, where it would remain for fourteen days before being taken down again.
Outside the office, Jens found the notice board, which was hung on the wall some distance from the entrance, protected by locked glass doors. The wall around the board was filled with notes that people had pasted up themselves in an attempt to find missing family members. There were both children searching for parents and vice versa, spouses searching for each other, and all sorts of other hopeful inquiries.
It was clear that the war had created an incomprehensible chaos, not only in the form of destroyed houses, factories, roads, and railways, but also in the form of families that had been torn apart and were now desperately searching for a sign of life from their loved ones.
Jens now made it a habit to walk past the notice board every Sunday, and already after a couple of months there hung a note with information about Udo's address in Kiel.
Jens had feared that Udo had gone to America, so he was relieved to see that Udo was still living in Kiel. Jens now quickly wrote a letter and soon received a reply. Udo had spent the time since they parted investigating whether his father's customers and suppliers were still intact and ready to do business with him again.
In Germany there wasn't much demand for luxury goods, but in the Scandinavian countries the rationing was gradually being eased everywhere, and there would be good opportunities to once again sell goods like coffee, chocolate, and cocoa. People couldn't buy everything they wanted, but after all more and more.
Udo had been nervous about whether customers would do business with a German company, but the wholesalers Udo had spoken to had no reservations about it.
Udo was now working to reestablish connections to the suppliers the company had had in the past around the world, and when that was in place, they could start doing business gradually. Udo envisioned that they should start by importing and selling coffee, as it was a commodity that was always in high demand.
At the end of the letter, Udo reminded Jens of their agreement about startup capital and asked him to transfer a larger sum of money as soon as possible. If they were to be able to buy the coffee at a good price, they would have to place a larger order, and subsequently money would be needed to have the coffee roasted, packaged, and stored until it was all sold.
Jens wrote back that he would come to Kiel with the money as soon as he had freed it up and that Udo should just continue getting the business going.


The same evening that Jens had written the reply to Udo, he brought out the diamonds from his hiding places. In an almost miraculous way, he had managed to keep them hidden from prying eyes throughout all the time he was in the prison camp. He therefore still had a large handful of diamonds, of which just a few pieces would bring him a fortune.
The problem was just how he was going to get the diamonds sold. Jens had no idea where one bought and sold diamonds. He had actually never even seen a diamond before they opened the chest in Italy. The only thing he knew was that diamonds were the most precious gemstones in the world and that they were sold for enormous sums if they were large enough.
The only way out Jens could see was to talk to Hans about what he should do. As a goldsmith, Hans must know something about gemstones, and he might also know how to get them sold at a proper price.
That evening when they sat talking after dinner, Jens said after working up his courage for a while: "Listen here Hans, I want to ask if you can help me with a little problem I have?"
Hans looked at Jens with interest and said: "If I can help you, I'd be glad to. What's your problem?"
"You're a goldsmith, so you must know something about diamonds, right?"
"Yes, I do. Diamonds and other gemstones are an important part of the most precious jewelry, but why do you ask about that?"
"Now you'll see," said Jens, after which he took a couple of diamonds out of his pocket and placed them on the table in front of Hans. Jens continued: "I need an appraisal of the stones, and I also need to get them sold somehow."
Hans picked up both stones and looked at them before saying: "They look really fine, but let me get my loupe so I can better assess what quality they are."
Hans now went into the living room and came back with a loupe, which he fixed in his eye, after which he began to study the stones closely. After a while, he put the loupe on the table and said: "Those are really fine stones you have there. They're very large, and there are almost no flaws in them. They're really worth a fortune. Will you tell me where you got them?"
Jens answered without hesitation: "No, I won't, but I haven't killed anyone to get them. Let's just say I found them sometime during the war."
"OK, that's fine. It's not really my business where you got them."
Jens now took the stones and put them back in his pocket before saying: "Can you help me get the stones sold? I have no idea where one sells diamonds or how I can get a reasonable price for them."
Hans now asked to see the stones again, and after studying them thoroughly once more, he said: "I'd like to buy the stones from you, and I'll give you a good and fair price for them. If you want a better price in these times, you'll have to go to Switzerland and seek out the diamond dealers in Bern or Zurich. Before the war, the right place to go would have been Antwerp, but that market is completely destroyed now, after we exterminated the Jews from Holland. It will recover, but it will take many years."
Jens sat thinking for a long time before he said: "I trust you, Hans, so I'd like to sell the diamonds to you, but I need the money in cash and preferably in dollars. Do you have access to that much money?"
Hans smiled a bit mischievously and said: "Yes, I actually do. Fortunately, my entire fortune wasn't in the safe. When do you need the money?"
"As soon as possible. I'm hoping to be able to start a business in Kiel with a fellow soldier, and that requires quite a bit of capital."
"I can have the money for you in a week. That's soon enough, isn't it?"
"That's fine. I also need to get a suitcase and some nicer clothes to travel in before I leave. Wouldn't it also be wise to get a pistol when I'm traveling with so much money?"
"If you can get a pistol, it's definitely a good idea. People are committing assaults for small amounts these days, and if anyone suspects you have large valuables with you, you're really in danger. Law and order are not at all in place in this country yet."
There was now silence between them for a while before Hans said: "Do you plan to come back to Munich when you've delivered the money in Kiel, or is the plan that you'll stay up there?"
"I actually don't know yet. If there's something for me to do in the company and it otherwise looks like we can get it going, I'll probably stay in Kiel. Otherwise I'll come back here. I hope you still need me and will let me stay here in the apartment."
Hans smiled and said: "You just take the time you need. There's always a place for you here. Even if my son should come home, there's plenty of room here in the apartment and plenty of work with the restoration."


The next day was Sunday, and Jens set off for a large flea market that was held every week at Marienplatz by the town hall in the center of the city.
The flea market was not a place for smart businessmen to make a quick buck. On the contrary, this was where people sold everything they thought they could do without in order to get a little money for daily living.
Much of what was for sale was worthless, but there were also fine antiques, jewelry, and paintings that could be bought at a price far below their real value, simply because the sellers were desperate to get some money.
Jens was looking for some nice clothes he could travel in and a good solid suitcase. After walking around the market for a while, he came across a stall where a man and a woman were selling exactly clothes, shoes, bags, and suitcases. As far as Jens could see, the goods were of the finest quality and the clothes looked like they were his size, so he went over to ask about the prices.
When Jens asked about a suit hanging on a clothing rack, he got talking to the man, who told him that before the war he had traveled around the world selling agricultural machinery. The factory he worked for was converted during the war to produce tanks and was targeted by bombing raids several times until it finally lay in complete ruins. The man had been unable to find work after returning from the war, so now they were selling his nice clothes and whatever else they could spare.
An improvised curtain had been hung up that served as a fitting room, and Jens now tried on both a suit and shoes as well as a very elegant trench coat. The clothes fit well, and they quickly agreed on a price, where Jens got a suitcase cheaply included in the bargain.
Jens now paid the agreed price and walked home contentedly toward the apartment. When he traveled in the nice clothes and with the fine suitcase, he would be perceived as a businessman on a trip and not as a poor returning soldier. Jens had a feeling that the clothes would somehow help him look forward to the good life that he hoped would come when they got the business going in Kiel.
