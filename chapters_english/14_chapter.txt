Copenhagen/Funen/Germany, July 2019


The sun was shining from a cloudless sky as Malene and Ole drove out of Copenhagen one day in mid-July. After various interchanges, they had finally made it onto the motorway heading toward Odense. Malene sat at the wheel and enjoyed the sound of the powerful engine purring along only slightly faster than the permitted 130 kilometers per hour.
They were now on their way south on a trip they expected would take about fourteen days, so Malene had found it a bit difficult with the limited possibilities for carrying luggage in the car. There was only a small trunk at the front of the car, and the rest of the luggage had to go inside on the back seat. In the end, however, they—especially Malene—had managed to limit what they needed to bring so everything could fit.
They were both very excited and eager for the adventure they were about to embark on. They had managed to keep the trip secret from everyone they knew, although it had sometimes been hard not to blurt out everything—it was all so exciting that it was almost constantly on the tip of their tongues to tell about everything they were going to experience on the trip.
Malene's girlfriends had of course asked with interest whether she was now seeing Ole again, but she had brushed it off by saying they were just old friends going on vacation together. Ole had of course also gotten a lot of comments about the trip, but it was just as much the car that was interesting to his male friends.
There were even a couple who had begged for a ride, and Ole had discovered that he was actually proud that his father had invested in a Porsche. It suddenly put his father in a somewhat more flattering light than his life had otherwise invited as the boring jeweler who just kept the family business going.
Both Malene and Ole had kept an eye out during the past month for signs that they were being watched, but they hadn't discovered anything. Ole had once thought that a couple of things had been moved around in the apartment one day when he came home from work, but he wasn't sure and hadn't paid much attention to it. Ole was also aware that if he told Malene about his suspicion, he risked her not wanting to go on the trip at all.
They had chosen to drive in the middle of the week so they could avoid the weekend traffic. They hoped this would help them avoid most problems with traffic jams on the motorways.
Their plan seemed to be working, at least initially, as there was only light traffic across Zealand. They encountered only a few cars with caravans or cars completely filled with kids and luggage, and since there weren't many trucks either, it was easy and effortless to get going.
They chatted along the way about everything and nothing, and suddenly they were at the toll station in front of the Great Belt Bridge. Ole had registered the car for "Pay by Plate," so they drove almost straight through the facility and up onto the bridge ramp.
In the beautiful weather, the high bridge was fantastically beautiful as it stretched across the sun-glittering water. The weather was completely clear, so they could see from the northern tip of Langeland in the south to Kerteminde and Romsø in the north.
Ole had never driven across the Great Belt Bridge in a car before, so he was completely captivated by how beautiful it all was. He enjoyed the sight of the small fishing boats and the large cargo ships in the strait, the bird life and the grazing sheep on Sprogø, and the beautiful view over the low bridge toward Nyborg and Funen.
After they had driven for a while on Funen, Malene said: "Well, we'll soon be in Odense. Are you looking forward to seeing your childhood home again?"
"No, I wouldn't say that," said Ole. "I haven't really thought about it in all the time since my father died, so it's probably becoming a closed chapter. But it's okay to see it one last time before the new owners take over."
"What about your father's shop—has that been sold too?"
"Father sold it a couple of years ago. He couldn't manage to run it anymore after he got arthritis."
"It's none of my business, but you must have inherited a hell of a lot of money from your father? You've inherited both the money from the sale of the business and now also the sale of the house."
"Yes, it adds up, but you know I've never cared that much about money. As long as I have enough for my rent and daily necessities, I'm actually quite content."
Malene said with a smile: "Yes, I know you well in that respect too, but I'll have to teach you to appreciate a little luxury. You certainly have plenty of money for that, even if we don't get the treasure."
"Well, we'll see. Maybe you can teach me a bit about luxury on this trip," said Ole. "After all, we'll be together for the next fourteen days."
Shortly afterward they turned off the motorway and headed toward the center of Odense. After a short drive, the city's residential neighborhoods began to spread on both sides of the road. First villas from the fifties and sixties, but the closer they got to the center, the older the houses became. When they finally turned off the main road onto the small residential streets, the houses were from the twenties and thirties.
Ole's childhood home was a stately two-story villa—painted yellow with a black tile roof. The house had many fine details like friezes above the windows and small dormers in the roof, but it was clear that it needed some loving care. The wall paint was peeling in many places, and the windows were practically crying out for paint. The garden was more or less overgrown, so all in all the house gave a somewhat sad impression of having seen better days.
Malene and Ole parked the car in the small carport beside the house and went up to the front door, where Ole found a key and let them in. If the house had looked worn from the outside, it was much worse inside. The house was completely emptied of all furniture, and the decay was now clearly visible. There were moisture stains in the corners, and the walls were clearly yellow around the squares where pictures had hung. After the carpets had been removed, the old varnished floors were now exposed. The floors were almost completely black with age in several places, and some of the pile from the carpets had stuck to the varnish in many places.
Malene said, a bit shocked: "Well, you can clearly see here why you should always sell a home while it's still furnished. It's not exactly a pretty sight."
"No, you can see that my father didn't keep the house properly maintained in recent years. After he got arthritis, he had enough to do just getting through daily life. He worked in the shop for many years even though he was ill."
"It's actually strange that he bought a Porsche when he was so affected by arthritis. He must have had great difficulty driving it."
"Well, it must have been a dream he had. I looked at the invoice he got when he bought the car, and I can see that he only drove about a thousand kilometers a year in the couple of years he had it."
Malene said, astonished: "OK, that wasn't much—that's just a couple of trips to the beach in summer. I think the engine needs to be properly used, so it's good that we're going down the German motorways. It can really stretch its legs there."
"Yes yes, take it easy," said Ole a bit skeptically. "We need to get used to driving at those speeds. We've never tried it before."
"No, that's true, but we'll certainly learn. But tell me, who had the courage to buy the house?"
"It's a young couple," said Ole. "They apparently plan to fix up the house and then sell it again with a nice profit in a couple of years, but let's go upstairs now so I can show you the crawl space where it all began."
They went upstairs and into the former guest room, where all furniture had now been removed. Ole went over to the crawl space door and opened it.
Malene crouched down and looked into the crawl space. She said: "It's completely dark, so I can't see a thing."
"Then it's lucky I brought a flashlight," said Ole and handed her the small flashlight he had in his pants pocket.
Malene took the flashlight and shone it into the crawl space on both sides: "There's nothing left except dust and dirt now, but it's strange that you lived in this house for so many years without discovering that there was access to the crawl space in this room." Malene stood up and handed Ole the flashlight.
"It's probably because there was a large, heavy bookcase in front of it," said Ole. "We hardly ever came into this room, and there was no reason to move the furniture around when it was never used."
"No, there may be something to that, but you certainly had a lot of space when you just let such a large room stand empty."
"Well, we did have plenty of space. The house was actually too big for us, because it was built for many children and servants, and I was the only child here, and we never had servants. We got a housekeeper when my mother died, but I think Father stopped that as soon as I left home."
They walked around the house a bit more, and gradually Malene began to see all the fine details the house contained: stucco ceilings, wood paneling, herringbone parquet floors, built-in radiators, paneled doors. She said: "This could be a fantastically beautiful house if it's properly renovated. You can easily see that it was built by people with a lot of money."
"I'm sure the young people will do it properly," said Ole. "At least that's what the real estate agent said they would."
When they had been through the whole house and Ole had said goodbye to it all, they went outside, where Ole dropped the house keys in the mailbox; now that chapter in his life was definitively over.


After the visit in Odense, the journey now took them across Funen, through Southern Jutland, and to Germany. They stopped once when they came to a rest area just north of Rendsburg and the Kiel Canal.
Here they filled the car with gas and went into the cafeteria to get something to eat. Immediately they could see that the place looked sad and run-down, so they were about to turn around at the door. However, they were quite hungry by now after being on the road since early morning, so they decided to give the place a chance.
Malene ordered a Wiener schnitzel and Ole wanted a currywurst with French fries. They sat down at a table and began to eat but stared at each other after the first few bites. It was simply the worst food they had ever had. Malene's schnitzel was cold and tough as shoe leather, and Ole's French fries were greasy and soft.
Malene grimaced and said: "I don't think I've ever had worse food than this."
"I completely agree," said Ole. "We should have checked Tripadvisor before we came in here. It's really bad."
"Well, we probably won't get sick from it, and it can keep hunger at bay until this evening."
They hurried to swallow what food they could get down, and after a quick trip to the toilet, they were back on the road heading south.
When they had driven a bit, Malene said: "Where have you actually put the pistol? We agreed to bring it."
"I just put it in my bag. There's no luggage control at the border crossings anymore."
Malene said: "No, that's true, but maybe we need to grab it quickly, and then it's no use having it in the trunk."
Ole said, a bit surprised: "What the hell could happen that would require us to grab a pistol?"
"I don't know, but it's not small change we're after, so just to be safe, it would be nice to have the pistol nearby."
"Can we wait to bring it into the car until tomorrow when we leave Lübeck?" said Ole. "We're almost there."
"OK, let's do that—it's not that important."
"We should probably have tried shooting with it too. We don't even know if it works."
Malene said: "I've had it taken apart and oiled and cleaned everything, so it should work."
"What about the cartridges—don't they get too old?" said Ole. "It's been more than seventy years since they were put in the crawl space."
"Gunpowder doesn't get too old. As long as it's been stored dry, it should work."
"Maybe we can find a place along the way where we can try shooting with it."
Malene said, a bit irritated: "We'll see. We definitely need to make sure no one can hear us when we shoot. I don't know what the penalty is for having a loaded pistol in Germany, but it's probably steep."
Ole couldn't help but think about how absurd it was that he was now sitting in a Porsche on his way to Italy to retrieve a large treasure with a pistol in the luggage. It was just so far from the life he had lived for many years now that it was almost hard to believe that what he was experiencing right now was reality.
Shortly afterward they drove over the Kiel Canal, where a couple of large ships were cutting through the landscape below them. In the clear weather they could glimpse Rendsburg to the right, the old border town between Schleswig and Holstein.
Ole said: "If we're going to try driving fast in the car today, it's about time. We need to turn off soon, and the rest of the trip is on country roads."
"Well, then we'd better see what this little car can do," said Malene and pressed hard on the accelerator.
The Porsche leaped forward, and they were pressed hard back into their seats. Soon the speed was up to over 220 kilometers per hour, and the landscape flickered past them in a blur. There was almost no traffic, just a couple of trucks in the inner lane, so they could keep the speed all the way until they had to turn off toward Neumünster and Lübeck.
Ole, who had never driven much faster than what was allowed in Denmark, bitterly regretted at first that he had encouraged Malene to drive faster. He was almost certain that his last hour had come. Gradually, however, he got used to the speed and could relax more and actually enjoy the ride a bit. It was actually quite exciting to try driving a car at such tremendous speed. He was almost sad when he could glimpse the signs up ahead showing where they had to turn off.


They now drove for about half an hour on the country road, after which they began to drive through the modern suburbs of old Lübeck. Shortly afterward they could see the old Holstentor towering up ahead, and behind it the city's many church towers reaching toward the sky.
It was easy to see that the city had once had real power, with all the wealth it had required to build all the large churches.
The GPS led them into the old city along the moat, and they easily found their way to a large parking garage in Schüsselbuden, which was only a couple of hundred meters from their hotel.
They had both packed a couple of small bags with the essentials for the couple of overnight stays they would have on the way to Dongo. The bags were placed on the back seat, so they were easy to grab, and they were quickly out of the parking garage and on their way up to the hotel.
The streets were filled with shops selling everything from clothes and shoes to marzipan and postcards—typical for a city that houses both many permanent residents and large numbers of tourists. The tourists walked almost shoulder to shoulder in the streets, admiring the beautiful old houses.
Malene sighed and said: "It's crazy how many people there are here. It's almost like Venice."
"I actually read somewhere that there are many tourists in Lübeck," said Ole, "but I didn't realize it was this bad."
"Do you think we'll even be able to see anything? It's almost impossible to make your way through all these people."
"Let's just go to the hotel. If we're lucky, our room is ready, and then we can rest for an hour or so. The tourists who are only here for a single day will probably start heading home soon. When they're gone, everything will probably be easier."
The hotel, which was on a corner right in the center opposite the Marienkirche, was a nice and well-maintained three-story building that had clearly been built after the war—no attempt had been made to make it look old.
At the hotel they were received by a couple of smiling middle-aged women who quickly completed the check-in. They were lucky that their room was ready, so one of the women took their luggage and began to walk up the stairs toward the second floor.
Ole started to protest, as it went against his entire upbringing for a woman to carry his luggage, but Malene nudged him and whispered: "Stop interfering with their way of doing things. That's probably how they want it."
Ole held his tongue, and they followed the woman up to the room, which was at the end of a corridor and had a view of a small newly built cultural center on the other side of the street.
Ole stood looking out the window and said: "I wonder what was on the lot across the street before they built the cultural center. Surely they're not allowed to just knock down the old buildings—they have to preserve those."
"I think it was bombed-out ruins from the bombing of the city during the war. Many of the houses here in the city are completely new or heavily restored. That's how it is in many German cities."
"Yes, of course, I know that, but you don't think about it when you're just walking in the streets. At home you also see many new houses mixed in among the old ones."
"That's true," said Malene, "but we haven't always been so good at taking care of our cultural heritage." She smiled and said: "I can't help but notice that you only booked one room. We're not a couple as far as I know."
Ole became quite embarrassed and stammered: "Uh, no, that's right. I didn't think about that at all. It's certainly not because I had any ulterior motives."
Malene looked at him a bit mischievously and said: "Well, let's see what thoughts you've had."
After resting for about an hour, they left the hotel to see the city. It was now late enough in the afternoon that the stream of tourists in the city streets had thinned out considerably.
Ole asked: "Is there anything specific you'd like to see? We only have a couple of hours before everything closes."
"No, I haven't really thought about it. Let's just stroll around the streets a bit and look at the city. We can go into a couple of the churches and maybe have a beer somewhere."
For the next hour or so, they walked around the streets to get an impression of the city. Many of the old houses were so carefully restored that it was easy to see what an impressive city Lübeck had been in the Middle Ages. There were several large churches and many impressive merchant houses in the city. Their tour of the city ended in front of the Marienkirche, which they went in to see.
Near the entrance there was a row of display boards showing how the church and the surrounding city had looked right after the war and how the reconstruction had slowly erased all traces of the destruction. The church interior was large and bright but lacked almost any form of decoration.
At the front of the church under the tower lay a smashed bronze bell that had clearly fallen from the top of the tower, and in a niche on one side of the church there was a row of display boards showing the frieze The Dance of Death from Lübeck, which had also been destroyed during the bombings.
When they came out of the church, they walked to the square in front of the town hall, where there were several outdoor cafes. They each ordered a large ice-cold draft beer and sat down in the shade under a large parasol.
After they had sat for a while enjoying the good weather and the good beer, Malene said: "What's actually the plan when we get to Koblenz tomorrow? We can't just go up to the address and knock on the door."
"No, we need to approach it a bit cautiously, but first we need to find out where the family lives. I've checked with the German phone directory, and there's no one named Fleischer living on the street anymore. We'll have to hope we can find someone who can remember the family and maybe knows what happened to them."
Malene looked a bit skeptical and said: "That probably won't be so easy after so many years."
"No, I don't expect it to be, but we have to try. Jens placed great emphasis on the family getting half of the valuables. If we can't find the family, we'll have to give the money to some charitable cause in Germany."
They now sat in silence for a while watching the life unfolding in the square, after which they went back to the hotel to get ready to go out to eat. Ole had booked a table at the restaurant Schiffergesellschaft, which was a couple of hundred meters from the hotel.
After a brisk walk in the mild evening weather, they arrived at the restaurant, which was located in a beautiful building that appeared to be completely unchanged from when it was built in the 16th century.
When they came into the room, it was packed, and there was a tremendous noise of talking and laughter; it was clearly a place where people had a good time. The restaurant didn't seem to have changed in all the years. The ceiling was hung with large chandeliers and model ships. All the seating was leather-covered benches, and most guests were seated at long tables with room for ten people.
They stood waiting at the entrance, as a large sign clearly indicated, and after a couple of minutes, a stylish elderly gentleman came and showed them to their seats. When they had been given menus, Ole rubbed his hands and said: "This is just the kind of food I like—solid German country cooking with cabbage and potatoes."
"Yes, but fortunately you can also get something that doesn't look quite as heavy," said Malene. "I think I'll have some fish."
They placed their orders, and shortly afterward they were both sitting with plates piled high.
Malene said: "We certainly won't leave here hungry with these portions."
"No, they mean well. I think I'll still have a portion of red berry compote for dessert. I haven't had that since I was a child."
Malene said: "If they have red berry compote on the menu, I want it too. I can't remember when I last had it. I'll just not eat so much of the side dishes, and then I can probably eat dessert."


When they had finished eating, they strolled slowly back toward the hotel, full and satisfied. Without really noticing who took the initiative, they walked the last stretch holding hands.
When they got up to the room, they got ready for the night, and when they got into bed, they made love as if they had never been apart. It was both wonderfully familiar and at the same time completely new.
Ole congratulated himself for not having booked two rooms for them. Now it was so simple and straightforward to resume their relationship; something they both wanted and needed.
The next morning they got up early, and after a solid breakfast, they went down to the parking garage, where they threw the bags into the trunk at the front. Malene said: "Remember we agreed that the pistol should come into the car this morning."
"I certainly remembered," said Ole. "I just wanted to make sure there's no one watching me with a pistol in my hand."
Ole looked around carefully, and when he was sure there were no observers, he took the pistol from the bottom of his bag and put it under the passenger seat.
"There's like a small pocket under the seat where I've put the pistol," said Ole, "so it won't slide back and forth during the drive. Just don't move the seat—you might crush the pistol."
"Why didn't you just put it in the glove compartment? It would be easier to reach there."
"That's because it's the first place that gets opened if anyone ever wants to search the car."
Malene said, impressed: "Good thinking, I must say. Have you also found a good place for the keys?"
"I have," said Ole proudly. "They're also hidden under the passenger seat. I've taped them together and tied them up under the seat. They won't be easy to find."
Malene said with a smile: "You really have thought it through. So you're not completely hopeless after all."
"No, there's still something ticking up here," said Ole, laughing. "But let's get going now. We have about 7 hours of driving ahead of us with some breaks and so on."
"Yes, let's get going. Today I think you should drive, so you can also try driving really fast."
"I'll drive, but I won't drive as fast as you did yesterday. I need more practice before I dare try that."
They got into the car, and shortly afterward they were on their way to Koblenz.
