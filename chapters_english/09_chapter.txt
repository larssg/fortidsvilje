Rome, April 2019


The small living room lay dark and stuffy, lit only by the bit of daylight that filtered in through the heavy dark curtains. Suddenly an old-fashioned telephone rang, placed on a table in one corner.
An upright middle-aged man dressed in a tuxedo came in and answered the phone without either saying hello or introducing himself. After listening for a brief moment, he said thank you and hung up again. The man then left the living room and walked down a long hallway, where he stopped outside one of the doors and knocked gently.
"Yes, come in," came a voice from behind the door.
The tuxedo-clad man opened the door to the room, which clearly functioned as an office, bowed briefly, and said: "Excuse me, Mr. Russo, but there's a message from Dongo."
Russo, who was sitting behind a desk in the room, said: "And what was the message?"
"There are two Danes who have booked a 14-day stay at Albergo Dongo in July. They booked a room this evening," said the servant.
Russo looked up at the servant and said: "That sounds very interesting indeed. Thank you for the message." Russo signaled that he wanted to be alone, and the servant left the room and carefully closed the door behind him.
Russo retrieved an old address book from one of the drawers in the desk, turned to Albergo Dongo, and dialed a number. The phone was answered immediately, and Russo said: "Hello, Alberto. I understand there are two Danes who have booked a room with you for a longer period in July?"
"Yes, that's right. They just booked a room for 14 days in July a little while ago."
"Give me the information you have about the guests."
"I only have contact information for a woman. She was the one who booked the room."
Alberto passed on the name, address, email, and phone number of the person who had booked the room, and Russo carefully wrote it all down.
When the conversation with Alberto was finished, Russo dialed another number and said without further explanation: "Come to my apartment now."
Shortly afterward, there was a knock on the office door, and a very old man supporting himself on a crutch was shown in.
Russo said: "Welcome, Giancarlo. I have news from Dongo."
"That sounds exciting. What has happened?"
"There are two Danes who have booked a room for 14 days in July at a hotel in Dongo. It could easily just be a coincidence, but as you know, we've always kept an extra eye on Danes in the area."
"Yes, it has something to do with Mussolini's mistress shouting that the Dane and the German had stolen the car and all their belongings," said Giancarlo as he sat down. "She apparently knew enough German to understand that the soldiers were a German and a Dane."
"That's right, and the host has also confirmed that there were two SS soldiers in the car. The strange thing is just that there's no record of a Danish SS man. He must have somehow gotten into the car along the way and then disappeared again after the German SS man was shot by the partisans. That's also what best explains how the chest could disappear as it did. The Dane must have taken the chest and hidden it somewhere."
"What do we do now? Should we put surveillance on the two tourists already in Denmark, or should we wait until they come to Dongo?"
Russo thought for a moment and then said: "We usually wait until they come to Dongo, but I have a feeling that tells me it might pay off for us to start surveillance quite quickly this time. It's not common to book 14 days in Dongo. There's not that much to see, and the low mountains aren't particularly interesting to hike in either."
"Do we have anyone we can put on the task in Denmark?" said Giancarlo, looking concerned. "It will be terribly expensive if we have to send people from here in Rome."
"Fortunately, we have two sympathizers employed at the embassy in Copenhagen. They can be tasked with starting a first discreet check of who it is that has booked the vacation. If we then find it relevant, we can later start proper surveillance with our own people from here in Rome."
"Should we inform the others in the group?" said Giancarlo. "They also have the right to know that there's development in the case."
"It's not necessary at first. Let's see who we're dealing with before we involve too many in the decisions. We two do have the authority to make the necessary decisions."
"Fine, then we'll do that. I'm curious to hear what they find out in Copenhagen. It would be fantastic if it finally turns out to be treasure hunters heading down here."
Russo smiled and said: "Yes, it would be good after all the years we've been waiting in vain. We also have the advantage that they don't know we're on their heels, but let's first clarify who they are. It could just be random tourists who want to come down and enjoy the beauty of Lake Como. I'll call a meeting of the entire group if it turns out there's substance to this case this time."
Giancarlo rose with difficulty from the chair, said goodbye, and went out the door. Russo sat and pondered things for a while, after which he called a number in Denmark and passed on the contact information he had received from the hotel in Dongo.
The recipient sounded surprised at first to be called, but quickly composed himself and repeated the information Russo gave him. They agreed to start investigating the matter immediately and arranged to speak as soon as the investigations were completed.
Russo put the phone on the table and walked around the office for a bit to gather his thoughts. In a way, he had just issued half a death sentence. If the Danes really were after the treasure, they would inevitably be liquidated as soon as they had found the treasure. There was no possibility that they could be allowed to live with the knowledge they possessed. He would have to take that on his conscience, but it was still strange that the war could continue to claim its victims almost 70 years after it ended.
Russo took a bottle and a glass out of a desk drawer and poured himself a large whisky. He needed it after the day's decisions, and the drink could also serve as an aperitif before he was to have his dinner, which was always served at ten in the dining room.
Tonight he was dining alone, and he was grateful for that. He was not in the mood to be sociable—too many thoughts were running through his head for that. It was almost unbearable once again to have to wait and see if this was finally serious about getting hold of the treasure.
