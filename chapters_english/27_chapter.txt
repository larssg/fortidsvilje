CHAPTER 27

DENMARK
1952


The train from Middelfart to Odense was half-empty on this Tuesday morning. Jens sat in first class, leather suitcase in the rack above him, watching the flat Danish countryside scroll past the window.

He looked like any other businessman—quality clothes, confident posture, the kind of man who belonged in the better carriages. No one would have guessed he was dying.

The diagnosis had come three months ago. Lung cancer, advanced, probably inoperable. The doctors had recommended surgery anyway—a small chance was better than none—and Jens had agreed. He'd survived Stalingrad, survived the war, survived the chaos of postwar Germany. He wasn't ready to simply wait for death.

But the surgery was scheduled for next month. And there was something he needed to do first.

The suitcase contained everything necessary to find the treasure—maps, instructions, the story of how he and Paul had stolen Mussolini's diamonds. He'd spent weeks preparing it, writing out the details in careful German script, drawing diagrams, explaining the booby trap and the keys that could disable it.

He'd considered giving everything to Udo. His partner had earned it—years of loyalty, of keeping Jens's secrets, of building their business together. But something held him back. The diamonds were his and Paul's. They'd killed for them, nearly died for them. Letting them pass to a German, even one he trusted, felt wrong.

Better to leave them to family. Even family that hated him.


His sister Helga lived in Odense, in the same house where she'd lived before the war. Jens had visited twice in those early years, before everything fell apart, before he became something his family couldn't acknowledge.

Now she wouldn't even speak his name.

He'd considered simply appearing at her door, explaining what he'd brought, begging for forgiveness or at least understanding. But he knew how that would end. Helga would slam the door in his face. If she let him inside at all, she'd throw the suitcase into the street the moment he left.

No. The suitcase had to be hidden. Somewhere in the house, somewhere it might lie undiscovered for years, until Jens was dead and forgotten, until some future generation stumbled upon it and wondered at what they'd found.

Udo had watched the house for him, noting the schedules, identifying the window when it stood empty. Helga worked at a jewelry store in the city center, returning home each afternoon around two. Her husband was at work all day. The children were grown and gone.

The house would be empty until early afternoon.

Plenty of time.


The tram dropped him at the end of the quiet residential street. Jens walked purposefully, a visitor expected, a man who belonged. The neighboring houses were silent, curtains drawn against the morning sun, but he knew eyes were watching. There were always eyes.

At Helga's door, he rang the bell and waited, counting to thirty. Then he produced his picks—skills learned in the camps, never forgotten—and went to work on the lock.

Sixty seconds. The door swung open.

He stepped inside, tipping his hat to an imaginary hostess, closing the door behind him. Anyone watching would have seen a guest being welcomed. Nothing suspicious.

The house was silent. Familiar. The same furniture he remembered from before the war, the same photographs on the walls, the same smell of soap and coffee. As if time had stopped in this small bubble while the rest of the world burned.

He climbed the stairs to the first floor.

The guest room was exactly as he remembered—narrow bed, small desk, a low bookcase covering most of one wall. He'd slept here twice, decades ago, before everything changed.

The bookcase was perfect. Deep enough to hide the suitcase behind it, heavy enough that no one would move it casually. He began removing books, stacking them on the bed, working methodically despite the weakness that pulled at his limbs.

The illness was stealing his strength faster than he'd expected.

When enough books were removed, he gripped the bookcase and rocked it away from the wall. The effort sent spots dancing across his vision, but he kept pulling until he'd created a gap wide enough for the suitcase.

That's when he saw it.

A crawl space hatch, hidden behind the bookcase. Access to the dead space beneath the roof—a void where something could lie undiscovered for generations.

Better. Much better.

He pushed the bookcase further, forcing his failing body to comply, until he could reach the hatch. It opened with a creak of old hinges, revealing darkness beyond. Jens pushed the suitcase through the opening and gave it a hard shove, sending it sliding deep into the crawl space, far from any casual inspection.

Now to put everything back.


The work took far longer than it should have. His arms trembled. Sweat poured down his face despite the cool morning. By the time the bookcase was back in position and the books restored to their shelves, Jens was near collapse.

He staggered down the stairs, pausing in the hallway to catch his breath, to make sure he'd left no trace of his visit. The clock showed he'd been inside for nearly two hours.

Too long.

At the door, he made his show again—a wave, a tip of the hat, a mimed farewell to the empty house. Then he walked down the quiet street, forcing his legs to maintain a steady pace.

Halfway to the corner, he felt his coat pocket and froze.

The keys.

He'd meant to leave them with the suitcase—the two brass keys that could open the chest without triggering the explosives. But in his exhaustion, he'd forgotten. They were still in his pocket, useless now, separated from the instructions that explained their purpose.

He almost turned back. Almost.

But his strength was gone, and Helga would be home soon, and the risk of being discovered outweighed everything else. Whoever found the suitcase would have to obtain their own keys, or find another way to open the chest.

Not his problem anymore.

Jens continued walking, leaving behind the house, the suitcase, the treasure, the last connection to the man he'd been.

The train was waiting at the station.

Germany was waiting across the water.

And somewhere in the mountains of Italy, seventy-three diamonds sat in darkness, patient as the dead.
