Denmark 1952


Jens sat on the train on his way from Middelfart to Odense. He looked like any other first-class traveler - neatly dressed and with a solid leather suitcase in the luggage rack.
The business he and Udo had worked to get started had gradually grown so large that they could live comfortably off the profits. The first couple of years had been lean, with rationing on almost everything and great difficulty getting permission to import luxury goods. However, the restrictions had gradually loosened, and they could now do business both in Germany and in Scandinavia.
Jens had already been on business trips several times in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and everywhere his disguise as a German who could speak a bit of broken Danish had worked perfectly.
The future had actually looked bright for Jens until a few months ago, when after coughing heavily for a period, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. The doctor had recommended surgery, even though the chance of recovery was very small, and Jens had chosen to have the operation because he couldn't bear just waiting for death. At least something was being done now, even if it might be in vain.
Jens had decided that he would pack a suitcase that would make it possible for whoever found it to locate the treasure. Jens had no family other than his sister, so he would leave the suitcase in her house. If he was lucky enough to recover, he would retrieve the suitcase and go to Italy himself, and otherwise he hoped that either she or one of her descendants would someday find the suitcase.
The easiest thing would of course have been to visit his sister, but Jens was sure she would slam the door in his face without listening to what his errand was. If he was finally allowed to deliver the suitcase, she would probably throw it out unopened as soon as he had left.
Jens had considered giving the keys and instructions to Udo, but somehow he felt it was wrong for the treasure to pass into foreign hands. If his sister or her children and grandchildren benefited from the money, it was as if he himself also got something out of it.


Udo had discreetly surveilled the sister's house a couple of times and had found out that the house was empty from the morning until early afternoon, when the sister came home from her work in the jewelry store. Jens had therefore taken a very early morning train from Kiel and was now in Odense just after eight.
At the station square he got on a tram that went out to the district where his sister lived, and shortly afterward he stood in front of the house in the quiet residential neighborhood.
He was sure that the women in the surrounding houses were mostly at home, so he had to assume that someone had spotted him and was following what he was doing. Jens didn't want the police on his back, and so as not to look like a burglar, he walked briskly up to the front door and rang the bell. He now pretended to wait for someone to answer, but in reality he was working hard to pick the lock.
Jens quickly defeated the lock, and when the door opened, he tipped his hat as if greeting someone before going in and closing the door behind him. He hoped the little act could convince curious eyes that he was an expected guest in the house.
Before the war, Jens had visited his sister and her family a couple of times and had always stayed overnight in a guest room on the first floor. He remembered that in the room there was a low bookcase completely filled with books, and he was sure the bookcase was wide enough that he could hide the suitcase behind it.
Jens hurried up the stairs, and when he entered the guest room, it looked exactly as it had the last time he had visited. It was clearly a room that wasn't used much, and the bookcase stood exactly as he remembered. He now took off his hat and coat and began to remove books from the bookcase so he could move it. The bookcase was heavy, so many books had to be moved before it could be rocked away from the wall.
When Jens finally, after a long time, had moved the bookcase enough that he could get the suitcase wedged in behind it, he spotted a crawl space hatch hidden behind the bookcase. Immediately Jens changed his plans. It was far better to hide the suitcase in the crawl space - there it could lie hidden until someone in the future started renovating the house.
Jens now pushed the bookcase out far enough that he could get the crawl space hatch open and put the suitcase inside. As an extra precaution, he gave the suitcase a firm push so it slid a good distance away from the opening.
Now he just had to get the bookcase back in place and fill the books onto the shelves. Jens immediately got to work on the task, but he could clearly feel that the illness had sapped his strength, and only after a long time was he finished. The sweat was now pouring off him, but there was no time to rest. He had already been too long in the house, so he staggered down the stairs, put on his coat and hat, went out the door where he pretended to say goodbye, and walked as fast as he could down the residential street away from the house.
When he had walked a bit, he happened to feel one of his coat pockets and discovered that he had forgotten to put the keys on top of the suitcase. At first he was about to turn back, but then thought better of it - whoever found the suitcase would either have to get keys or break the locks themselves.
