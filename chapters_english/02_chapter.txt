CHAPTER 2

NORTHERN ITALY
April 1945


The Mercedes purred along the shore of Lake Como, its engine barely audible above the whisper of wind through the open windows. The road hugged the water's edge, switchbacking through tunnels of cypress and emerging into sudden dazzling views of the lake below—deep blue, impossibly still, indifferent to the war that was grinding to its bloody conclusion in the valleys all around it.

In the front seats sat two SS men. Their uniforms told a story: threadbare at the elbows, stained with mud and darker things, patched in places where shrapnel or bullets had found their mark. The death's head insignia on their caps had lost its shine months ago. These were not parade-ground soldiers. These were survivors.

Between them on the seat lay two MP40 submachine guns and a pair of steel helmets. They hadn't needed the weapons today. But the war wasn't over yet.

"At least he's traveling in style," said Hauptsturmführer Paul Fleischer, his hands easy on the wheel. His German was clipped, Bavarian. "One last ride in a limousine."

The man beside him—younger, leaner, with the watchful eyes of someone who'd spent too long in combat—glanced at the rearview mirror. "The trucks?"

"Fifteen minutes behind us. Maybe more. I lost them on the switchbacks outside Menaggio." Paul allowed himself a thin smile. "They won't catch up before Dongo. And when we stop for food, our passengers will want to freshen up. That's when we move."

Jens Raben nodded slowly. He was Danish, not German, though the distinction had ceased to matter years ago. He'd made his choice when he was nineteen, full of ideology and certainty. Now he was twenty-three and full of nothing but the desire to survive.

"And if they change their minds? Decide to eat in the car?"

"They won't. Three hours on these roads—they need a toilet, a real meal. Trust me."

From the back seat came a sharp voice in Italian: "Speak a language we can understand. I don't like not knowing what you're saying."

Paul switched to Italian without missing a beat. "My comrade doesn't speak Italian, Duce. I was merely updating him on our route."

The man in the back seat snorted. Benito Mussolini was sixty-one years old, though he looked a decade older. His famous jaw was slack, his eyes hollow. The architect of Italian fascism, the man who had once commanded millions, was fleeing through the mountains in a borrowed car with an escort of two.

Beside him sat Clara Petacci, thirty-three, dark-haired, beautiful even now. She'd been his mistress for years. Everyone knew it. She didn't seem to care.

"How much longer to Dongo?" Mussolini demanded.

"Ten minutes."

"Good. I'm hungry."

Paul caught Jens's eye and held it for a moment. Then, still in Italian, he said: "There's a trattoria in the main square. The owner is a loyal man. We'll be safe there."

Safe. The word hung in the air like a bad joke.


They'd been planning this since yesterday, when Paul had seen something through a cracked door at the villa where they'd stopped for the night.

Mussolini, bent over a small chest. The click of a lock. Then the Duce's thick fingers reaching in and withdrawing a stone that caught the lamplight and shattered it into a thousand points of fire.

A diamond. And not just one—the chest had been full of them. Payment for safe passage into Switzerland, presumably. Or a retirement fund for a dictator who'd run out of countries to ruin.

Paul had watched, barely breathing, as Mussolini handed the stone to their host in exchange for provisions and lodging. Then the chest had been locked again and carried back to the car.

Two keys. The Duce kept them in his jacket pocket.

Paul had told Jens everything that night, whispering in the darkness of the room they shared. They both knew what was coming. The war was lost. The German units in Italy were scattered, broken, fleeing north in a desperate scramble for the Austrian border. The partisans controlled the mountains. The Americans were pushing up from the south.

Mussolini was a dead man walking. Everyone knew it. The partisans wanted him—wanted to make an example of him, hang him from a meat hook for the whole world to see. And anyone caught with him would share his fate.

The logical thing was to slip away. Ditch the uniform, find civilian clothes, disappear into the chaos.

But the chest changed everything.

Why die poor when you could live rich?


Dongo was a small town, sleepy, huddled against the lakeshore. The Piazza Barachini opened onto the water, dominated by a four-story town hall painted white and yellow. In the center of the square stood a war memorial—a stone pedestal topped by a bronze eagle, the names of the fallen inscribed on brass plaques.

World War I. The last generation's catastrophe. This generation was busy creating a new list of names.

Paul parked the Mercedes in front of a small trattoria. The sign above the door was hand-painted, faded. There was nothing to suggest it was anything special—just another village restaurant struggling to feed its customers in a country where food had become scarce.

Both SS men climbed out with their submachine guns ready. They scanned the square—empty except for a few old men on a bench, a woman hanging laundry from a balcony, a dog sleeping in the sun.

Nothing.

Paul opened the rear door. "We'll eat here. Quickly."

Mussolini hauled himself out of the car with the effort of a man twice his age. Clara followed, smoothing her dress, blinking in the bright light.

Inside, the restaurant owner recognized them immediately. His face went through a rapid sequence of emotions—fear, disbelief, then a kind of desperate eagerness. He bowed, he fawned, he cleared a table near the back and produced two bottles of wine that had probably been hidden from less welcome guests.

"Rabbit," he announced. "Fresh shot this morning. With potatoes. It's all we have, but it's good, very good."

Paul and Jens cleared the restaurant of its other customers—a pointed gesture with the submachine guns, a nod toward the door. The message was clear. Everyone understood.

When they were alone, Mussolini sat heavily in a chair and draped his jacket over the back. The keys were in the right pocket—Paul could see the outline of them through the fabric.

"Wine," the Duce said. "And quickly."

He pushed back from the table and headed toward the toilet at the rear. Clara excused herself and followed.

The moment they were out of sight, Paul moved.

He was across the room in three strides, the jacket in his hands. Jens was already at the door, scanning the square.

"Go," Paul said. "Now."

They were in the car before the restaurant owner understood what was happening. The engine roared to life. The tires bit into the cobblestones. And then they were gone, accelerating north on the lake road, leaving behind a dictator, his mistress, and the last shreds of Paul Fleischer's loyalty.


Jens watched the town shrink in the side mirror. His heart was hammering.

"That was too easy."

"They're arrogant. They've always had people to protect them. They don't know how to survive on their own." Paul's knuckles were white on the steering wheel, but his voice was steady. "By the time they realize what's happened, we'll be in the mountains."

"And then?"

"Switzerland. The border's ten kilometers away, as the crow flies. We'll have to go on foot once the roads run out, but the snow's melted. It's manageable."

Jens thought about what they'd just done. They'd left Mussolini stranded in partisan territory, without protection, without transport. The man would be dead within days. Hours, maybe.

But he would have been dead anyway. The partisans were closing in from all sides. The escape to Switzerland had never been realistic—just the fantasy of a man who couldn't accept that his time was over.

We're just speeding up the inevitable, Jens told himself. And taking what would have been lost anyway.

It didn't make him feel better. But it didn't make him slow down, either.

"We need to get off the main road," Paul said. "Find a track into the mountains. We'll drive as far as we can, then continue on foot."

"And the uniforms?"

"We'll find something. A farmhouse, maybe. Take what we need."

Jens didn't ask what would happen to the farmers who got in their way. He already knew.


Ten minutes later, they turned off the lake road onto a narrow track that climbed steeply into the hills. The Mercedes groaned on the gradient, its suspension complaining as the pavement gave way to gravel, then dirt.

The lake fell away below them, a sheet of hammered silver in the afternoon light. Somewhere down there, in that little town by the water, a dictator was discovering that his last guards had abandoned him.

Jens wondered how long it would take for the partisans to find him.

Not long, he suspected.

Paul drove with grim concentration, nursing the car around hairpin turns, coaxing it over ruts that threatened to tear the undercarriage loose. The road—if you could call it that—grew worse with every kilometer.

Finally, they reached a point where even the Mercedes couldn't continue. A rockslide blocked the track ahead, boulders the size of small cars scattered across what had once been a path.

Paul killed the engine. The silence was sudden and complete.

"From here, we walk."

They retrieved the chest from the trunk. It was smaller than Jens had expected—no bigger than a large cigar box—but heavy. Solid. The kind of weight that came from precious things.

Paul tucked it into a rucksack along with ammunition, a water bottle, and what remained of their rations. Jens carried the submachine guns.

The mountains rose before them, pine-covered slopes giving way to bare rock and, higher still, patches of snow that gleamed in the fading light. Somewhere beyond those peaks lay Switzerland. Safety. A new life.

If they could reach it.

If the partisans didn't find them first.

Jens adjusted the strap of his weapon and followed Paul up the trail. Behind them, the Mercedes sat abandoned on the mountainside—a gleaming black monument to everything they were leaving behind.

They didn't look back.
