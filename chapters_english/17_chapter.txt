17.
Germany, July 2019




The three-lane motorway stretched out before them as smooth as a living room floor. Ole sat behind the wheel and enjoyed the trip, which had so far taken them through Hamburg and a good stretch of the way toward Bremen.
He kept to a speed of around 160 kilometers per hour and actually thought that was plenty fast, even though Malene had teased him a couple of times for not letting the car really stretch its legs when they had the opportunity.
They had eaten lunch at a rest area a bit south of Hamburg and had experienced a completely different service than the day before. Here everything was clean and nice, the staff was smiling, and the food was well-prepared and varied. They quickly agreed that if all German motorway cafeterias were like this, it was almost a pleasure to visit them.
They were now driving through an area that looked quite desolate. There were no houses to be seen for miles around, and as they approached an exit, they could see a large forest on the left.
Malene shouted: "Exit here and turn left so we get over to the forest. Then we can probably find a place to test the pistol."
Ole did as she said, and when they had gotten onto the country road, he immediately turned sharply onto a forest road that quickly led them deep into the forest.
After they had driven for five minutes, Malene said: "Stop here. You can just park on the side of the road. It won't bother anyone. There was a path that went into the forest a bit further back. Let's try to follow it. I'll bring the pistol."
Ole pulled over to the side of the road, and shortly afterward they were on their way into the forest along a narrow path that wound upward into the twilight under the trees.
It was hot and oppressive in the forest, and Ole was glad when, after walking for about fifteen minutes, they came to a clearing where Malene signaled that they should stop and said: "We haven't seen a single house, either from the forest road or here from the path, so it's probably quite safe to try shooting with the pistol here."
"If anyone hears the shots, they'll probably just think there's a hunt going on somewhere," said Ole, "so they probably won't be alarmed."
Ole looked around the clearing and continued: "Shouldn't we see if we can find something to shoot at?"
In the middle of the clearing there was a pile of cement blocks that looked like the ruins of a small house that had collapsed long ago. Malene now went over to the pile of stones and arranged it so that a couple of the stones stood free and could be used as targets.
Malene walked back to Ole, took the pistol out of her pocket, and held it out to him: "Look here. On the left side there's a safety that needs to be flipped down for the pistol to fire." Malene flipped the safety up and down a couple of times to show Ole how it worked. "On top there's a slide that moves back and forth and pushes projectiles into the chamber. When I give you the pistol in a moment, you need to chamber a round by pulling the slide back and releasing it. Then the pistol is ready to fire, and you can just pull the trigger until the magazine is empty."
Malene now took a magazine and pushed it up into the grip. Ole quickly said that he would like Malene to shoot first so he could see how it was done.
Malene now chambered a round and flipped the safety down. She positioned herself in a shooting stance with slightly spread legs and both hands on the pistol. When she pulled the trigger, there was a tremendous bang, and one of the stones suddenly had a hole right in the middle. She fired again, and the stone now shattered into several pieces.
Malene held the pistol out to Ole and said: "Now it's your turn. I've removed the round that was in the chamber, so remember to chamber a round as I said."
Ole now took the pistol, positioned himself the same way as Malene, chambered a round, aimed at one of the stones, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Ole tried again with the same result.
Ole looked questioningly at Malene, who looked at him teasingly: "You didn't listen to what I told you a moment ago. What did you forget to do?"
Ole thought about it for a moment and then remembered that he hadn't flipped the safety down. Ole smiled a bit at the cheap point she scored, but then positioned himself to try again. When he pulled the trigger this time, the pistol went off with a bang and kicked back violently due to the recoil.
It didn't look like he had hit anything, so he tried again, but this time too there was no trace on the stones. Ole now tried for the third time, and finally a chip flew off one of the stones.
Malene said: "We'd better stop now, otherwise someone will just come. Now you've also seen how hard it is to hit anything with a pistol. If the distance is more than ten meters, a pistol isn't very effective unless you're really practiced."
Ole was just about to answer, but suddenly they heard barking and loud voices that seemed to be coming from the other side of the clearing. Without saying a word, they both turned around and rushed back down the path.
Fortunately, the path went downhill, so they could keep up a high pace without getting too out of breath. The whole time they were running, they could hear barking and voices not far behind them, so the pursuers had apparently also broken into a run.
They reached the car and threw themselves into the seats, after which Ole started and they shot off down the forest road with dirt and stones standing in a cloud behind them. Shortly afterward the road turned sharply to the left, and just before he turned the wheel, Ole could see the pursuers coming out from the forest path in the rearview mirror.
Ole now slowed down a bit and said: "Phew, damn, that was close. Where did they suddenly come from? It was completely deserted here. I could see they had hunting rifles with them."
"Then it was probably a hunting party. They probably thought we were poachers."
"Yes, of course. That's probably why they seemed so angry."
They now tried to find their way out of the forest again, but it wasn't so easy because there were no landmarks to navigate by. There was nothing but a lot of trees and roads going in all possible directions.
They tried to keep a direction that led them east so they wouldn't come back to the hunting party, and after half an hour of driving back and forth, they finally found their way out to a small village called Bötersheim. From here they could use the GPS to find their way back to the motorway toward Koblenz.
They now drove off again southward with Ole behind the wheel, just not quite as fast as before their little adventure in the forest. Ole was a bit shaken after what they had experienced and sat thinking about what would have happened to them if the German police had caught them while they were carrying a loaded pistol. It wasn't pleasant to think about.
Ole said: "Don't you think we should get rid of that pistol? It almost got us into trouble. We could just throw it in one of the rivers we cross."
"I think that's a really bad idea. We're already far away from those who were after us, and they have no idea who we are. If you just pull into the next rest area, I'll put the pistol back in place under the seat. We'll hopefully never need it, but I'm glad to have it along for safety."
"I don't know how much safety it provides. I couldn't hit a damn thing," said Ole a bit resignedly.
Malene looked at him indulgently and said: "No, but we were shooting at more than ten meters distance. A pistol is a close-combat weapon, and if you shoot at something at less than five meters distance, you can certainly hit it. At least if the target is as big as a human body."
"I really hope I never have to try to shoot a person. I don't think I can do it at all. Especially not now that I've seen how much damage a pistol shot can do."
Malene placed a reassuring hand on Ole's arm and said: "Take it easy. We certainly won't have to use the pistol to shoot other people. If it ever comes to be used, it's probably enough just to threaten with it. Pull into the next rest area now, and we can have a cup of coffee and calm down a bit."
After the short break, Ole gradually relaxed and began to enjoy the trip. The motorway now went up and down large, long hills, and it was easy to see that they were now out of the flat North German plain.
There was almost no traffic, and without Ole really noticing how, the speed gradually increased until he was driving at over two hundred kilometers per hour. It wasn't until Malene asked him to watch his speed a bit that he saw how fast they were going.
It was clearly noticeable that the car was made for driving fast. It was as if it settled down at the high speeds and sat rock-solid on the road. Ole maintained the high speed, and it therefore didn't take long before they could see from the road signs that they were approaching Koblenz.


Ole had booked a room at a hotel close to the old town, and since the motorway led them right into the middle of the city, they found their way without difficulty.
The hotel was a newly built high-rise of 25 floors that was beautifully situated right down by the Rhine, which flowed along gray-green and mighty while the water glittered in the bright sunshine.
The car was safely parked in the hotel's underground garage, and they both now stood enjoying the view from the room on the 18th floor.
Malene said: "You really splurged this time. I saw down in the lobby that it's a four-star hotel we're staying at this time."
"Yes, we should have a bit of luxury along the way, I think," said Ole. "I inherited so much from my father that I can easily afford to sweeten our trip. I know we're on our way to find diamonds, but we can still enjoy the trip as a vacation too."
Malene now walked around and examined the large room they were staying in. There was both a sleeping area and an area with a television, chairs, and a table. Everything was well-maintained and spotlessly clean. The carpets were thick and soft, and the bed was huge and filled with pillows. On the bed lay two chalk-white bathrobes together with two pairs of slippers. The bathroom was large and equipped with an abundance of towels, and on the counter were tubes of various beauty products for free use. Malene smiled and thought that she could certainly get used to a bit of luxury on the trip. She was already looking forward to trying the contents of some of the tubes.
When she came out of the bathroom again, Ole had opened a bottle of sparkling wine from the minibar and poured it into two glasses. They now toasted each other while again enjoying the formidable view.
Malene said: "I don't think we've seen any vineyards on the way down here. Isn't this a wine region?"
"Yes, it is, but it's more on the banks of the Moselle that wine is grown around here."
"And how far is it to the Moselle from here?" Malene looked questioningly at Ole.
Ole pointed north and said: "We can almost see it from the window here. About a kilometer from here, the Moselle and the Rhine meet. That's what they call Deutsches Eck. There's a large monument and a viewing platform. If you want, we can walk over and see it before we go out to eat tonight."
"That sounds like a good idea, but let's relax a bit first before we venture out into the city. I feel a bit tired after everything we've experienced today. It's not that late yet either."
Malene lay down on the bed and fell asleep immediately. Ole sat for a while and looked at her. He thought that it had probably been nerve-wracking for her too, what they had experienced in the forest. She was just better at hiding it. Ole had actually thought they would find the house where Paul Fleischer had lived before the war, but that could easily wait until the next day, he thought. Ole set an alarm on his phone and lay down on the bed, where he fell asleep immediately.
About an hour later, they stood on the viewing platform at Deutsches Eck and watched how the two large rivers merged at a sharp angle to continue northward toward the outlet in Holland, now even more abundant with water than before.
Malene said: "This is certainly a different size of waterway than what we're used to from home."
"Yes, this is something completely different. Large barges and cruise ships sail on the Rhine. That would probably be quite difficult to fit on the Gudenå."
They now stood for a while admiring the view of the large castle that sat enthroned on the opposite riverbank, as a clear sign of how important it used to be to have power over the waterways.
In the square there was a large and bombastic monument that was crowned at the top by a huge equestrian statue flanked by an angel.
Ole pointed at the statue, smiled, and said: "That's quite a warlike statue they've put up here. I wonder who he's so angry at?"
"As far as I can see, the statue depicts Kaiser Wilhelm I," said Malene and walked a bit closer to the monument. "He was the one who united Germany into one large empire instead of a lot of independent kingdoms and principalities, as it had been before. He was King of Prussia when they beat us in 1864 together with Austria."
"Well, then he's not a nice guy. He actually doesn't look like one either."
They now walked along the Moselle River, holding hands and enjoying the good weather, like all other couples on vacation. They had hoped to find a place where they could have a drink before finding a restaurant, but to their surprise, there wasn't a single bar or restaurant the whole way to the old town.
The riverbank was clearly not designed for tourists. Most of the space was taken up by parking lots, and along the quay, large barges lay close together.
After walking a couple of hundred meters, they came into the old town, where they had expected to see old houses and narrow crooked streets. What they saw were fairly straight wide streets and houses built sometime during the first years after the war. A few houses looked old at first glance, but on closer inspection it was easy to see that they were just facades that had had some half-timbering stuck on.
The city was, on the other hand, full of restaurants, and since they hadn't booked a table in advance, they walked around the streets a bit to see what was most tempting. They passed restaurants advertising food from places as diverse as Italy, Cuba, Japan, and Argentina, in addition to all the German restaurants that were plentiful in the streets.
After they had walked for a while from restaurant to restaurant without being able to decide, Malene said: "Today I don't feel like German food, so shouldn't we just find a pizzeria? That's what I could go for. It's easy and quick."
"I'm actually a bit tired of German food too," said Ole, "so let's just find the nearest place quickly. I'm getting quite hungry by now."
At the next pizzeria they came to, there were free tables, and they were quickly served their food along with a large carafe of red wine. They ate with good appetites, and after a quick espresso they were out on the street again on their way back to the hotel.
They took the direct route home and passed the palace in Koblenz, which was an impressive edifice. The palace itself was about 150 meters wide and three stories high. In addition, there were two side buildings that stood like two large arcs on each side of the main building. The whole thing enclosed a park that had once been the prince's private garden but was now intersected by several large roads.
When they got back to the hotel, they sat down in the sitting area and discussed the day's events and what would happen in the next few days.
Malene said: "It was really unlucky that those hunters happened to be hunting the day we needed to use the forest. It's actually strange that they have time for it on a weekday."
"Yeah," said Ole and took a sip of wine, "but they're probably wealthy people who set their own working hours. They can go hunting whenever they want."
"Well, it doesn't matter now anyway. We got away from them, and we did test-fire the pistol. It works perfectly. It's almost unbelievable that it's been hidden away for so many years without being damaged at all."
"No, they made quality stuff in the old days. But it was also properly wrapped and completely soaked in oil."
Malene got up and went to the window, where she looked out at the river, which had now taken on a light orange hue in the twilight. It was as if she was struck by the seriousness of the undertaking they were engaged in. She got a feeling that they were heading toward something really dangerous, something that could cost them their lives in the worst case. It was an utterly priceless treasure they were on their way to find. It couldn't be that they could just drive down to Italy, dig up the treasure, and drive home again. As Jens Raben had written, there were certainly others looking for the treasure—people who probably wouldn't stop at anything to get their hands on the riches.
It became crystal clear to her that she and Ole were complete amateurs in the game they were entering. Neither of them had ever used violence against other people. In the world they had moved in, it was conversation and discussion that were used when reaching agreement, not brute force.
Malene shuddered a bit to shake off the gloomy thoughts and said: "I think we need to be very careful when we get to Italy. We must make sure we don't attract unnecessary attention, otherwise I think it could easily become dangerous for us. It's enormously valuable, what we're going to dig up. There are probably many who are willing to kill to get hold of even a small part of such a large treasure."
Ole could clearly sense that Malene was uncomfortable and nervous about the situation and said reassuringly: "We just have to stick to our cover story as hiking tourists. No one will find that strange. We'll just be a couple of tourists among a lot of others who also trek up and down the mountains."
Malene turned and looked firmly at Ole: "I hope that holds. But you must promise me that if we suspect someone is watching us, we'll start the car and drive directly home to Denmark."
"I promise. We certainly shouldn't put ourselves in danger just to find a treasure. Nothing is that valuable."
They now spent some time discussing how they should approach things when they got to Italy. They agreed that they would start hiking in completely different places than where the treasure was buried. Gradually, they would then approach the right place, but without it looking like they were searching for something.
They would have to try to find, as if by chance, the house Jens Raben had mentioned, and when they had found the treasure, they would have to transport the stones down from the mountain in bags they could have in their backpacks.
It would be necessary to go several times. Otherwise, it would seem strange that their backpacks were fuller when they came back from the hikes than when they left in the morning. They hoped they could complete the task in two trips, but time would tell if more were needed.


The next morning the sun shone from a cloudless sky, and after breakfast they set off in good spirits to find Florinspfaffengasse, where Paul Fleischer had lived before the war. They hoped somehow to find the family but set off without an actual plan for how they would approach it.
The street was only a short walk from the hotel in the middle of the old town, so they could easily have visited the street the evening before, but they had agreed to wait until they were fresh and well-rested.
When they arrived at the street, they took a quick walk through it and could now see that it was about two hundred meters long and bounded by a church at each end. It was clear that all the houses in the street except for a couple had been built after the war, but everything was nice and well-maintained and actually quite cozy to walk around in.
Malene and Ole walked slowly back through the street and tried to see if they could find a nameplate that said Fleischer. After they had walked through the street unsuccessfully in this way twice, they gave up and sat down at a small sidewalk restaurant next to one of the churches, where they ordered two ice-cold draft beers.
"This probably isn't the way we'll find Paul's family," said Malene. "We have no idea if they're even still alive or if they live on this street at all."
Ole took a sip of his beer and said thoughtfully: "No, you're right. It was probably a bit too naive of us to think we could just find them on the nameplate. These are just ordinary apartments here in the street, so it's quite unlikely that the family still lives here so many years later. They might not even live in the city anymore."
"We could try asking around. If we're lucky, someone might remember the family."
"Probably, but I just haven't seen anyone except tourists who look like they're over fifty, and we can't just start ringing doorbells at random places in the street."
"No, of course not. It's a completely impossible task. I think we should leave it until we're back in Denmark. Then we'll have to find someone who knows how to find old personal records in Germany."
Ole looked quite relieved, and he smiled and said: "That's what we'll do. So we won't think about how to find the Fleischer family for now. Now we can just concentrate on finding the treasure."
Malene smiled back, drank the last of her beer, and said: "Then let's play tourists the rest of today, and then we'll drive toward Italy tomorrow. I'd like us to start by looking at the two churches here at each end of the street."
They now got up and walked into Florinkirche, which was located on the square where they had been sitting. The church interior was impressively high with many windows that provided a lot of light to the completely white-painted space. There was virtually no decoration, just row after row of pews up toward the altar, where at the very top there were two small bluish glass mosaics. They walked together around the space, but since there wasn't really much to see, they were quickly out in the square again.
"That was quite boring," said Malene. "It almost looks like all the furnishings were destroyed during the war. It might as well have been a completely new church."
Ole said: "Yes, there wasn't much to see in there, but I saw at the entrance that it's an evangelical church. That might explain why there isn't much decoration. Maybe the next church is Catholic—then there's guaranteed to be much more ornamentation to look at."
They now walked hand in hand through Florinspfaffengasse, and shortly afterward they reached Liebfrauenkirche, which was located in a square at the end of the street.
This church was considerably larger than the first they had seen and actually appeared to be quite well-preserved. It was clear that it was a Catholic church they were about to enter, for above the entrance hung a large figure of the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus.
The church interior was indeed very colorful, with a lot of red and golden edges. Along the columns hung a number of wooden figures of various saints, and at the end of the altar hung a huge crucifix with a figure of the crucified Jesus.
Malene and Ole now walked together around the church again while studying the various things the church contained. When they were close to the exit again, they caught sight of a very old woman who was tidying up a small chapel where there had apparently been a devotional service earlier in the day.
While Ole was studying a large coat of arms hanging on the wall, Malene thoughtfully studied the woman. Suddenly she gathered her courage and asked in her best school German: "Excuse me, may I disturb you for a moment?"
The woman looked at Malene with old watery eyes and said: "Of course, my child, what can I help you with?"
Malene said: "May I ask how long you have lived here in the neighborhood?"
The woman walked over to the nearest church pew, where she sat down and invited Malene to sit next to her by patting the bench. The woman smiled and said: "I've lived here for 95 years because I've never lived anywhere else. Even when everything was smashed during the war, I stayed."
Malene waved to Ole so he could also participate in the conversation and said: "Then maybe you can help us."
Malene pointed to Ole and continued: "In my boyfriend's family, there is someone who fought on the German side during the war. Unfortunately, he died shortly after the war ended, but he left a letter asking that someone from the family go down and thank the family of one of his soldier comrades who had saved his life by sacrificing his own. No one has done that until now, and now it may be too late. We hope that you can remember the family and maybe also know where they live now."
The old woman looked at them thoughtfully and then said: "I don't know all the families, but I know many here in the neighborhood. Especially those who come here to the church. What is the family's name and where did they live?"
Malene answered: "The family's name is Fleischer and they lived somewhere in Florinspfaffengasse. The soldier who saved my boyfriend's family member was named Paul."
The old woman lit up and said: "I know the Fleischer family very well. They're not Catholics, so they don't come here to the church, but I lived close to them for many years. I also knew Paul, and it's true that he didn't come back from the war like so many other fine young men." A tear ran down the woman's cheek. It was clear that she was now in the grip of memories.
Malene and Ole let the woman dwell in the past, and when she seemed ready again, Malene asked cautiously: "Do you know where we can find the family now?"
The woman now looked almost mischievously at them and then said: "Yes, I do. Paul grew up in Florinspfaffengasse number 12 together with his mother and sister. They were lucky that the house came through the war almost unscathed, so they could stay in their apartment. Both the mother and sister are dead now, but it's still the family who lives in the apartment. I believe it's now Paul's sister's daughter who lives in the apartment. Shall I walk you to the house?"
"No, thank you," said Malene. "We're on our way to Italy, so we'll try to visit Paul's family when we pass by again on our way home. Do you know if Paul's niece's last name is Fleischer?"
"It's not. She married into the name Jantzen, so that's the name you should look for."
Malene and Ole thanked the old woman many times and walked elated out of the church again.
Ole laughed and said: "Holy cow, Malene. That was a damn good initiative you took there. Now we have complete control over Paul's family."
"Yes, it was lucky that the old lady happened to be in the church, otherwise I don't know how we would have managed to find Paul's family. But let's take a walk through the street and see where number 12 is."
It turned out that Paul's childhood home was quite close to the Catholic church. The building was a white three-story residential building with six apartments, and Jantzen was listed as the name of the family on the top floor on the right.
Malene and Ole were very pleased that they had now solved the first of the tasks they had ahead of them. Luck had been with them, and it was as if the whole adventure they had embarked on suddenly looked easy and manageable.
They now spent the rest of the day being tourists, strolling around and seeing all the city's sights while enjoying the good weather.
When they sat sharing a bottle of wine again in the evening, the conversation flowed merrily between them, and they were actually looking forward to getting to Italy and starting the search for the treasure.
Neither of them any longer thought about the fact that it might not be so straightforward to retrieve kilos of jewels without others catching wind of what they were doing and demanding their share of the pie.
The next morning they packed the car and drove in good spirits southward toward Italy and Lake Como.
