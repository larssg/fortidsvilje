19.
Northern Italy, 1947


Jens had now lived in the prison camp for a couple of years and was gradually becoming deathly tired of the boring daily life the prisoners had in the camp. They suffered absolutely no hardship—the food was plentiful and the tents were thick enough to keep the cold out even in winter. All tents were also equipped with a small coal-fired stove which also helped the prisoners stay warm.
The prisoners had been given new clothes that didn't look like prison garb but more like ordinary civilian work clothes with trousers, shirt, and jacket. For many of the prisoners, it was a relief to get rid of the uniform, which they had now worn almost every day for the past years.
Many of the prisoners resolutely threw out their old uniforms, but Jens had chosen to keep his, even though it was worn almost completely out. There were too many memories attached to it for him to just throw it away.
He had carefully rolled it up and hidden it under the bed along with the Iron Cross. The diamonds and keys he had discreetly sewn into the lining of his new jacket, which he always had with him.
In fact, many believed that it was better to be in a prison camp than at home, where there was a severe shortage of basic necessities. At the same time, the housing shortage in Germany was completely desperate after most large cities had been virtually razed to the ground.
In the first period in the camp, there were plenty of activities for the prisoners to pass the time with. The camp had to be built from the ground up: the tents had to be set up and secured against wind and weather, a kitchen had to be built, holes had to be dug for the latrine barrels and walls and a roof built around them, a schoolhouse had to be built, and the main roads in the camp had to be covered with a thick layer of gravel to withstand the winter's often violent rainstorms.
The first months in the camp had therefore flown by, and for many it was almost like a trip back to recruit training with activities from early morning to late evening. Strict discipline was maintained, and the Hitler salute was still obligatory as long as there wasn't a prison guard nearby.


The problem for Jens and most other prisoners was now that there was nothing meaningful to do anymore. They still had drill a couple of times a week, but it was hard for the soldiers to see the point of the efforts. They would never go to war again. The idea that Germany together with the Allies would go against the Soviet Union to defeat communism was no longer talked about. It had been a dream for many, but everyone could now see that the time had long since passed.
Jens went to school a couple of mornings a week, where he learned mathematics and German grammar and spelling. At least it kept him a bit occupied, and it could never hurt to become more knowledgeable.
In the first months after the camp was established, they had also had courses in Nazi ideology, but gradually only very few showed up, and when their instructor was sent north for prosecution, the teaching was stopped.
There were now less than half of the original number of soldiers left in the camp. Every day a group was called up to the main building, where they were subjected to interrogations designed to expose those who had participated in war crimes. After the interrogations, the vast majority were sent home and the rest sent on for prosecution.


Of the original platoon Jens had commanded, there were now only a couple left, and even though he had been assigned a couple of privates whose NCOs had been sent on from the camp, there wasn't much work in leading the small group. It was increasingly mostly about keeping up the morale of the soldiers. Many feared the interrogation they had to go through, while at the same time hearing about the desperate conditions their families lived under at home.
There were some soldiers who toyed with the idea of escaping from the camp, but they were quickly taught that they were in enemy territory very far from home. The partisans were still extremely active in hunting fascists, and they would certainly make short work of it if they came across a lone SS soldier.
Jens had had no problems maintaining discipline in his platoon. They were all determined to make the stay in the camp go as smoothly as possible. In several cases with other platoons, it had been necessary to resort to punishment because some no longer wanted to submit to commands from others.
The punishments had in a couple of cases cost the soldiers their lives, and the harsh punishment methods had of course also helped improve the behavior of the remaining prisoners.
They had disposed of the bodies by throwing them into the latrine barrels. Because of the stench, the prison guards stood far away with their backs turned when the barrels were emptied from a pier into the Adriatic Sea, so they didn't discover the bodies that were carried with the current along the coast.


Apart from the weekly drill, there wasn't much physical activity in the prisoners' daily lives, and Jens had therefore made it a habit to run along the fence every day. If he took the trip around three times, it was enough to keep him in reasonably good shape.
In the beginning, he had run alone, but gradually more and more prisoners joined him, so in the end there were about 25 who took the trip. One of the soldiers who ran with Jens was his doppelgänger, whom he had spotted in Milan before they were sent to Rimini.
Jens had found out that his name was Udo Dressler and he came from Kiel. Udo had also been made aware of the striking resemblance between them, and they had joked a bit about whose father it was who had been fooling around too much.
Since they were the same age and had experienced much of the same during the war, they gradually became good friends and spent a lot of time together just chatting about this and that.
Udo was an only child and came from a wealthy merchant family that had operated in Kiel for generations. Up until the outbreak of war, the business had mainly dealt with importing goods from overseas areas. It was goods such as coffee, cocoa, and spices that the company had purchased and distributed to all of Germany and the Scandinavian countries. Udo had a good knowledge of Denmark, as he had several times accompanied his father on business trips to the country.
Udo's father was a veteran of World War I and a fervent Nazi, and he had been a member of the party almost from the start. It was therefore not even up for discussion that he should enlist in the SS and not the army when the war broke out.
Udo was actually not very interested in politics, and what he had experienced during the war had given him a distaste for Nazism. An attitude he only shared with Jens and no one else. It was far too dangerous to express negative thoughts about Nazism in the camp, where many were still convinced Nazis and were willing to kill for their convictions.
Udo's parents had been killed in a bombing raid in the last days of the war, and he was now without close relatives. Jens's situation was much like Udo's; he certainly had family, but they wanted nothing to do with him after he had enlisted in German military service.
They talked a lot about what would happen to them after the war. Udo was convinced that he would be released after the interrogations. He had not served in any of the concentration camps and had not participated in shooting prisoners of war on the Western Front. What he had done during the invasion of Poland and subsequently the Soviet Union would certainly not come to light as long as no Russians participated in the interrogations.
Udo would return to Kiel when he was released and see if there was anything left of the merchant business that he could build on. If not, he would emigrate to the USA to build a completely new life in the land of opportunity, as he said.
Jens was also quite certain that he would get through the interrogations without having to be held accountable in a courtroom, but he would not escape punishment when he eventually returned to Denmark.


Once when they were sitting and talking about the future, Udo said: "You could just come with me to the USA. It's such a big country that no one will find you there. Besides, I think the Americans don't care what you did during the war, as long as you're not a communist. That's what they seem to be most afraid of."
Jens replied: "I think I'd rather hide in Germany until things calm down. With all the chaos prevailing in the country, it must be possible to live completely anonymously for many years."
"I think you easily can, but the safest thing would probably be if you could assume someone else's identity. You speak German like a native. You could easily pass for a German. You could just take the identity from someone you know fell in battle."
"I've thought about that too, but I don't know how it could be arranged. If I take someone else's identity, I need to be sure he has no family who will start looking for him. It's probably also best if we're roughly the same age and height and build."
Udo laughed and said: "It actually has to be someone like me, and you even look so much like me that you could fool people if you happened to meet someone who knew me from before."
Jens smiled: "Well, that was actually a really good idea you came up with there. You'd better be careful that I don't get up to any tricks." Jens continued: "No, the easiest thing is probably just to settle down somewhere, make up a name and some story, and then say that all my papers have been lost. That can probably hold for many years before things are under control again."


A couple of days later, Jens was called for interrogation in the main building. There were five interrogation rooms in a row down a corridor, and the prisoners were distributed with four outside each room. The interrogations took about an hour each, so Jens could figure out that they weren't being too thorough in probing the past.
When Jens entered the interrogation room, three people sat at the table waiting for him: a British colonel, a civilian lawyer, an interpreter, and a secretary.
After Jens had sat down and the introduction was over, the colonel spoke: "Well, there we have the Danish volunteer. I was almost beginning to think we would have to keep you forever. It's only now, more than two years after the war ended, that the Danish authorities are asking to have the Danish prisoners of war sent home. They're certainly not in a hurry to get you back, one must say. There's something that suggests they'd rather see the back of you than the front."
Jens said nothing, but the tirade wasn't really aimed at him anyway, but more at the slowness of the Danish authorities.
The interrogation now began, and Jens was questioned about everything he had been involved in during the war. Jens skillfully avoided telling about anything other than actual combat operations, and when asked about the massacres of Jews and civilians in Poland and the Soviet Union, he denied any knowledge of them. He had to admit having heard about the terrible things that had happened, but maintained that his platoon had neither witnessed nor participated in any of it. Jens was well aware that his story was completely implausible; all SS units had participated in the crimes, so everyone was guilty of terrible crimes. Jens's and the other prisoners' luck was that the interrogators clearly didn't know much about the Germans' conduct in the east.
The interrogation also delved quite a bit into why he had actually enlisted to fight for Nazism when he came from Denmark and not Germany. They clearly wanted to clarify whether he was still a convinced Nazi. Jens dismissed it as youthful recklessness and idealism that he had regretted many times since, and said that he was now almost an anti-Nazi and simply longed to come home to Denmark to live a completely ordinary life with his family.
The interrogators seemed to accept Jens's story, and after about an hour the interrogation was stopped and he was asked to wait outside the door. After another ten minutes, the interpreter came out and gave him a paper stating that he was to be released and sent with the next prisoner transport north to Munich and from there on to Denmark.
The transport would depart by train from Rimini the next day, and the prisoners were to march from the camp early in the morning. Jens was given a duffel bag and told to go down to his tent and get the belongings he wanted to bring and then go back to the main building, where he would sleep the last night in a large dormitory.


When Jens was on his way down to the tent, he was caught up by quick steps. When he turned around, he saw that it was Udo who was trotting along behind him.
Udo said, when they were now walking side by side: "So, you're also ready to go home now."
"Yes, I am. Were you also interrogated today?"
"Yes, so I'm on my way down to my tent to pack. I suppose you are too?"
Jens replied: "Yes, I need to pack my things and then I need to appoint someone to take command of the group after me. There has to be someone in charge."
"That won't take long. Let's meet in half an hour up by the main building."
"It's a deal. See you in a bit."


When Jens got down to the tent, all the men were fortunately present, so he quickly told them what would happen now and appointed the one who would take over after him as leader of the group.
Jens could sense that the mood was subdued in the group. They were clearly sad to lose him as their chief and the one they could come to for discussing the problems they encountered daily in the camp.
Many had also used him as a confidant they could tell about their fear of how their family was doing, and the uncertainty they felt about soon having to be civilians after so many years in uniform.
To not drag out the agony, Jens hurried to pack his things, which was quickly done since he didn't really own anything. Over time he had bartered for some extra clothes, which went into the duffel bag along with the uniform and a blanket. When he was finished, he shook everyone's hand in farewell and wished them all the best going forward, after which he left the tent and walked briskly without looking back.
Jens now walked up to the main building, where Udo was already waiting with a duffel bag just as empty as Jens's.
It was still light and the weather was fine, so they sat down on a bench against the wall. Jens sat and pondered his situation and what would happen in the next while.
It was of course nice that he was finally getting away from the camp, but it also forced him to make a decision about what he would do with his life going forward. Now he had to act if he didn't want to be sent all the way back to Denmark to be thrown in prison.
Jens sat brooding for a long time, and finally Udo said: "You seem far away. Are you planning what you're going to do now?"
"Yes, I have to make a decision. Tomorrow we're on our way north."
"You only have two alternatives. You can either follow along all the way to Denmark, or you can try to escape along the way."
"I know that, but I think I'll try to escape somewhere along the way and then see if I can build a life somewhere. Then I'll have to invent a new identity that hopefully can hold."
Udo lit a cigarette and then said: "That should be possible. There are guaranteed to be many soldiers who have lost their papers and don't really have anything to come home to. I don't think anyone will be surprised by that. The hard part will probably be finding somewhere to live and some work so you can survive. There's a shortage of housing and work everywhere in Germany."
Jens thought about the large soldier he had met when he let himself be captured by the Americans. Arno Wittel had encouraged him to seek him out in Volkmarsen when he was released. Maybe that was the very best solution? Then he could get somewhere to live and find work while living in hiding from the authorities.
There was no hurry to dig up the treasure. It was safe and sound, and he could easily wait both five and ten years before retrieving it. There would certainly also be several years before tourists really returned to Lake Como. For many years to come, a lone German would attract great attention if he started wandering around in the mountains around Dongo.


The next morning they marched back to Rimini along the same road they had used when they arrived a couple of years before. The mood was now quite different and far more cheerful than the first time they had walked the route.
When they arrived at the railway station, a quite ordinary passenger train was waiting for them with steam up. They were clearly not going to wait long before the journey north began.
When they halted in front of the station, a British officer stepped forward and called them all up one by one, after which they were distributed in the cars. Jens and Udo got seats together in the last car, where at the back there was a small platform they could go out on to get some fresh air or just enjoy the weather.
Shortly after Jens and Udo had sat down, the train started, and they were quickly up to speed heading north.


There was a boisterous mood in the compartment. The prisoners were almost like children looking forward to coming home to their loved ones. Many of the prisoners weren't even twenty years old yet, so for them it was simply a longing to see their mother again.
Udo and Jens were also caught up in the good mood and participated in the fun with songs and jokes. Jens gradually became quite warm-hearted and for a while forgot all the worries he constantly had about the future. He gradually came to believe that everything would work out. He would escape from the train somewhere along the way and find his way to Volkmarsen, where he would invent a random identity.
It should work for some years, and if he was discovered many years later, there was probably no one in Denmark who would ask to have him extradited. The escape from the train wouldn't cause major problems, as there were only very few guards along—they weren't actually prisoners anymore but just civilians on their way home, so there was no reason to keep a close eye on them anymore.
The train journey only went slowly northward because as a special train they often had to hold back for the regular trains. After three hours of travel, they arrived in Bologna, where they received the first provisions of the journey, which were distributed on the platform. They now had an hour's break during which they could walk freely around the station and the nearest part of the city.
Udo and Jens stood in the station square smoking a cigarette, but they enjoyed that the sun was still so warm that they could stand with their jackets over their arms without freezing. It was clear that much of normal life had returned to the city. There was lively traffic of pedestrians, bicycles, and vans in the streets, and they could see several cafes and restaurants that were open and busy.
Udo smiled and said: "How wonderful it is to see a completely ordinary everyday life again."
"Yes," said Jens, "I've been longing for that for a long time too."
"It really makes you want to take a walk around town. Imagine being able to sit at a cafe with a beer or a glass of wine and just enjoy life."
"Yes, that wouldn't be so bad, but that'll come to us soon too."
"I'm quite sure of that. Germany will certainly rise again and rebuild everything that's been destroyed."
"But you won't see that if you go to the USA."
Udo threw away his cigarette butt and said: "No, let's see what I do. I still know many of my father's business contacts from before the war, so I might try to build the business up again, but that would require some capital and I can't quite see how I would get that."
Jens thought for a moment. Here was perhaps an opportunity to put some of the diamonds into play so he could secure a good livelihood. Jens said: "I might be able to help you with capital if you want to start the business up again. We could go into partnership if you want?"
Udo looked quite astonished: "Where do you have money from? You've never talked about that before."
"Where I got the money from doesn't really matter. The most important thing is that I can help you get started."
"Yes, that's true enough, but you've just never talked about having money before, so I was a bit surprised."
"Well well, but what do you say to it? You don't have to decide anything right now, but you can think about it. You first have to decide whether you want to stay in Germany or emigrate to the USA."
"That's true, but if I can get capital to start up the business again, then it's certainly attractive. I just couldn't see where I would get money from."
They were now called back into the train, where they continued talking about how they should approach the matter. Fortunately, they could talk together out on the platform behind the train car, so no curious ears could overhear what they were talking about.
After a long time of debating, they agreed that the best thing would be for Jens to escape from the train when they got to Germany. He would then head for Volkmarsen and try to build a life on a new identity.
Udo would go home to Kiel and investigate whether there was anything of his father's business that could be built on, or whether everything was destroyed. They quickly agreed that a joint business should only be started after a couple of years, since the luxury goods the company had traded in before the war were certainly not in much demand in a poor and destroyed country. When the economy had hopefully improved in a couple of years, Udo would contact Jens if he thought the business could be rebuilt.
Udo said: "Now you have to choose an identity, otherwise I can't find you in Volkmarsen."
Jens thought for a moment and then said: "Then I think I'll be called Dieter Schmidt. There are guaranteed to be thousands with that name in Germany."
"The name is fine, but you also need to be able to say something about where you come from, what your father does, whether you have siblings, and so on. Have you thought about that?"
"No, not yet, but I have plenty of time for that before we're in Germany."
"We can help each other come up with a good story. Then the time will also pass a bit faster."
Udo didn't try to question Jens about where he had gotten money, but Jens was well aware that he was curious. Jens didn't come from a wealthy family, so Udo must have thought he had stolen some valuables somewhere along the way during the war. Jens decided that he would probably have to come up with a cover story that could satisfy Udo's curiosity without revealing anything about the treasure.
