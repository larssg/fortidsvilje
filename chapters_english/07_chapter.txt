CHAPTER 7

NORTHERN ITALY
April 1945


Jens came down from the mountain as the sun began to set, moving through the trees like a ghost.

He had buried the chest. He had watched Paul die. Now he had to survive.

The terrain fell away toward the lake in a series of terraced slopes—vineyards gone wild, olive groves choked with weeds, the abandoned farms of people who had fled the war or been killed by it. Jens moved through this ruined landscape with the caution of a hunted animal, stopping every few minutes to listen, to watch, to make sure he was alone.

He wasn't wearing his SS uniform anymore—he'd burned it in the fireplace of the stone house, along with his Soldbuch and everything else that could identify him. The peasant clothes he'd found fit poorly, but they would have to do. If he was stopped now, he was just another refugee. One of millions.

The partisans controlled these mountains. He could hear them sometimes—distant shouts, the crack of gunfire, engines grinding along the roads. They were everywhere, flushed with victory, hunting down the last remnants of the occupation. Any German caught now would be lucky to get a bullet. The unlucky ones got worse.

But Jens wasn't German. He was Danish. And Denmark had been occupied too, hadn't it? He could claim to be a laborer, conscripted against his will. It might work. It might not.

Better not to be caught at all.


He found a hiding place as darkness fell—a dense thicket of brambles at the edge of a ravine, impossible to see into, difficult to reach. He wedged himself into the thorns and waited.

His mind drifted.

He thought about how he'd ended up here. A Danish boy from Odense, twenty-three years old, alone in the Italian mountains with a fortune in diamonds buried behind him and nothing ahead but uncertainty.

It had started with ideology. He'd been nineteen when he enlisted, burning with conviction. The Nazis were going to save Europe from the Bolsheviks, from the Jews, from the decadence of liberal democracy. He'd believed it all—every word, every promise, every lie.

The Eastern Front had cured him of belief.

He'd seen things there that he couldn't unsee. Done things he couldn't undo. The massacres, the reprisals, the casual brutality that became routine. He'd participated. Everyone had participated. It was that or be shot yourself.

By the time he reached Italy, he was empty inside. A machine that followed orders, killed when told to kill, moved when told to move. The ideology was gone, replaced by nothing but the instinct to survive.

And now here he was. Alone. Free, in a sense—free of the unit, free of the war, free of everything except the need to keep breathing.


He remembered how he'd met Paul.

It had been pure chance. His unit destroyed by American fighters, Jens had been walking along a mountain road when he'd spotted the convoy—a black limousine followed by two trucks. German vehicles, he could tell from the markings. A chance to rejoin friendly forces.

He'd stepped out onto the road with his hands raised, and the limousine had screeched to a stop.

The driver was SS—a Hauptsturmführer named Paul Fleischer, Bavarian accent, tired eyes. In the back seat sat a man Jens recognized from a thousand newsreels and propaganda posters: Benito Mussolini, the Duce himself, looking old and defeated and afraid.

"Need a ride?" Paul had asked.

"I need to get out of here."

"So do we. Get in."

They'd driven north, toward Switzerland, toward an escape that would never happen. And somewhere along the way, Paul had told him about the chest.

"He keeps it in the trunk," Paul had said, his voice low so the passengers couldn't hear. "Opened it last night to pay for lodging. It's full of diamonds. Rubies. Emeralds. Everything he's stolen in twenty years of power, converted to portable wealth."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I'm not going to Switzerland. And neither are you, if you're smart. The war is over. Germany is finished. The only question now is how we survive—and how much we take with us."

The plan had been simple. Wait for Mussolini to leave the car. Steal his jacket with the keys. Drive away with the chest.

It had worked.

And then the partisans had ambushed them, and Paul had taken two bullets in the chest, and Jens had crawled through a freezing stream with a thirty-kilogram chest of jewels while his only friend in the world died in the driver's seat.

Promise me you'll find my family.

I promise.

Swear it.

I swear.


Jens woke at dawn, stiff and cold, his muscles screaming from the cramped position he'd slept in. He had nothing to eat—his last bread was gone—and only a few swallows of water left in his canteen.

He had to move.

He waited until full light, then began working his way south. The goal was simple: find American lines. Surrender. Become a prisoner of war instead of a corpse.

It wasn't without risk. There were stories of prisoners being shot, especially SS prisoners. But a rested unit, a unit not fresh from combat—they would follow the rules. They would take him alive.

He just had to get far enough south.


The second night, he found a farmhouse.

It was small and appeared abandoned—shutters closed, no smoke from the chimney, no animals in the yard. But behind the main building was a small addition, and through the window Jens could see shelves lined with wheels of cheese.

His stomach cramped with hunger. He'd been walking for two days on nothing but water. The cheese was right there, unguarded.

He tried the door. It opened.

He was reaching for one of the wheels when a voice shouted behind him in Italian.

Jens spun. An old man stood in the doorway, a double-barreled shotgun aimed at his chest. The man was saying something—a demand, a threat—but Jens didn't understand Italian and it didn't matter anyway.

He threw the cheese.

It caught the old man in the face, and the shotgun went off—a deafening blast that tore through the air above Jens's head as he dove forward. He hit the old man low, driving him backward, and then his hands found the man's throat and squeezed.

It was over in seconds.

Jens stood over the body, breathing hard, his ears ringing from the gunshot. The old man's eyes stared at nothing. His neck was bent at an unnatural angle.

No thought. No hesitation. Just instinct, honed by four years of war.

Jens dragged the body into the cheese room and closed the door. He took two wheels of cheese and the old man's water flask. The shotgun he left—one barrel empty, one loaded, more trouble than it was worth.

Then he ran.

He didn't feel guilt. He didn't feel anything. The old man had been a threat, and now he wasn't. That was all.

Later, hiding in another thicket, eating cheese that tasted like sawdust in his mouth, Jens thought about what he'd become. A killer. A machine. Something less than human.

He wondered if he would ever feel anything again.


Three more days of walking. Three more nights of hiding, moving, surviving.

He saw German columns on the roads—trucks and half-tracks heading north, retreating toward Austria. He didn't reveal himself. Those men were still fighting a war that was already lost. He wanted no part of it.

On the fourth day, he walked into an American patrol.

They were young, most of them. Clean uniforms, well-fed faces, weapons that gleamed with oil. They looked at him with a mixture of curiosity and contempt—another ragged refugee, another piece of human wreckage left behind by the retreating Wehrmacht.

Jens raised his hands and said the only English words he knew: "I surrender."

They searched him. Found the diamonds in his pockets—a handful of stones worth more than these soldiers would earn in their lifetimes. They assumed he was a looter, and in a sense they were right.

They didn't find the keys. He'd sewn them into the lining of his jacket, and the stitching was invisible unless you knew where to look.

The Americans handed him over to the British, who handed him over to a processing unit, who eventually handed him over to the Danes. And somewhere in that chain of custody, someone discovered the truth.

He'd been SS.

Not just a collaborator, not just a conscript. SS. The most hated organization in the Reich.

They sent him to a prison camp. He spent four years there, surrounded by other men who had made the same choice he had—men who had believed, or pretended to believe, or simply followed orders. Some of them were unrepentant. Others had found religion, or politics, or some other framework to contain their guilt.

Jens found nothing. He simply endured.


When they finally released him, he went home to Odense.

His sister had married. She lived in their parents' house now, with her husband and their children. She didn't ask where he'd been or what he'd done. She didn't want to know.

No one wanted to know.

He got a job at a factory. He rented a small room in a boarding house. He lived quietly, invisibly, a ghost in his own country.

And every night, he thought about the chest.

It was still there. It had to be. Buried in the mountains above Lake Como, waiting for him to return. A fortune beyond imagination, hidden beneath a flat circular stone.

He couldn't go back. Not yet. The war was too fresh, the memories too raw. There would be people watching, people asking questions. He needed to wait.

So he waited.

Seven years.

And then his heart started failing, and the doctors told him he needed surgery—dangerous surgery, the kind you might not wake up from.

The night before the operation, he sat alone in his rented room and wrote a letter.

He addressed it to no one in particular. To whoever might find it, someday, in the crawl space where he planned to hide it.

He wrote down everything. The chest. The location. The keys. The promise he'd made to a dying man.

Find Paul's family. Give them their share.

I gave my word.

Then he packed the letter with his uniform, his Soldbuch, his pistol, and a few diamonds he'd managed to hide from the Americans. He put everything in a suitcase and hid the suitcase in the crawl space of his sister's house, behind a bookcase that no one ever moved.

Just in case.

The surgery was scheduled for the next morning.

Jens Raben never woke up.
