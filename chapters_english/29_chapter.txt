The mood was tense around the meeting table in the old palace. It was as if no one really wanted to open the conversation about all the bad news that had descended upon them in recent days.
Finally an old man cleared his throat and said: "Russo failed his task and lost the treasure. He was so close to succeeding, and then he let himself be ambushed by a couple of amateurs. It cost both him and his helpers their lives, and the treasure is now completely out of our reach."
A voice said: "It's not entirely clear what happened. Some evidence suggests that one of the helpers shot Russo."
The old man said: "I don't care what happened. Russo didn't get the treasure, and we're now back where we started. He should have listened when we said that three men were too few for the task, but he was so clever and wanted to decide everything himself."
A voice said: "Should we take revenge on the Danes? They're responsible for three of ours now being dead."
The old man stood up and looked around at all the participants: "We're not taking revenge on anything. The case is lost, and we shouldn't spend any more effort on it. Is that understood? I expect everyone to continue working as we've always done. Our cause will prevail. It will just take longer without Mussolini's treasure."





Koblenz 2019


The elderly woman sat in her kitchen drinking morning coffee while the morning news droned from the television. She was alone in the apartment. Her husband had died several years ago and the children had long since flown the nest.
Now that she didn't have to go to work anymore, she enjoyed taking her time in the morning. She rejoiced each morning that she could sit and relax while the other residents in the building hurried off to their various activities.
Her pension wasn't large, but she could manage if she was just careful with her money.
Just as she was about to get up to wash her plate and cup, the doorbell rang.
"Strange," she thought, "it's been at least ten years since anyone has rung my doorbell without me knowing they were coming."
When she opened the door, there stood a postal carrier with a small package, which she was given after duly signing for it.
After she had closed the door behind the postal carrier, she looked more closely at the package and to her surprise saw that it had been sent from Denmark. She didn't know anyone in the small country to the north, so she concluded that it was probably one of her children who had bought something for her on the internet - that's what young people did these days. She had just had a birthday, so she thought it was probably a delayed birthday present.
She now sat down at the kitchen table again while looking forward to opening the package - a completely unexpected gift was a lovely way to start the day. The package was wrapped in heavy paper and wound several times with twine, so she had to use scissors to get to the contents, which turned out to be a shoebox.
Now she was truly mystified, because who would think of buying shoes for her? Shoes weren't something you gave as a gift - they had to be tried on first to make sure they fit.
When she got the lid off the box, she saw that it was filled with crumpled newspaper, but when she stuck her hand into the paper, she got hold of another box, which was also carefully wrapped in paper and twine. After using the scissors again, she now sat with a small cardboard box containing a cloth pouch and a letter. She unfolded the letter and read:


        "Dear Mrs. Jantzen


I am sending this package to you because your uncle, during the war, shortly before he died, participated in some events where he earned a share of a treasure consisting of first-class diamonds. We have now found the treasure and are therefore sending your uncle's share to you. When you have the diamonds appraised, you will find that a great fortune is hidden in the pouch.
I hope you are in good health and wish you all the best for the future.


Yours sincerely


NN


P.S. Don't try to find out who I am. If you want to keep the diamonds, discretion is essential."
