Northern Italy, April 1945




Jens had now been traveling for six days. He had lived on the cheeses he found at the old man's place and water from the small streams that flowed from the mountains down toward the lake. Progress was slow because he only moved at night and lay in hiding all day.
He had been very cautious and made wide detours around all settlements.
Even when the cheeses ran out and he was extremely hungry, he made wide detours around all the settlements he encountered along the way. He must not be surprised again, as he had been at the cheese dairy. A couple of times a dog had barked when he crept past, but fortunately no one paid much attention to the animals' barking.


Jens lay dozing in his hiding place in a dense thicket when he suddenly heard the noise of engines and rhythmic marching. Jens cautiously raised his head so he could see down to the road, and shortly after, a military column came around a bend not far from where he lay. At the front drove a jeep with a large white star on the side, so it was easy to see that the column was American. After the jeep came a truck with a covered bed, and after that marched about 50 German soldiers. The column was brought up by another jeep.
There were no American soldiers to be seen other than two in each jeep, but there must be more in the truck. The German soldiers looked tired and somewhat disheveled, but still it wasn't enough with only four men to guard 50 prisoners.
Jens immediately thought that here was his chance to escape alive from the horrors of war. The easiest thing would be to simply step down onto the road and raise his arms in the air as a sign of surrender, but then he risked being searched and thereby possibly losing both the diamonds and the keys to the chest. Somehow he had to find a way to get in among the prisoners without being discovered by the Americans.
Jens had hidden quite close to the road, at a place where it turned sharply. So just when neither the front nor rear vehicles could see the place where he was hiding, he sprang forward and threw himself in among the prisoners.
There was some commotion and a good deal of muttering about this new prisoner, but it quickly settled down, and Jens was soon marching along with the others as if he had been part of the group all along.
A large, powerful soldier walking beside Jens said: "Well, that was quite an abrupt entrance you made there."
Jens said: "Yes, you could say that, but I just wanted to make sure not to surprise the Americans, so they might decide to shoot. This way they probably won't notice that another prisoner has joined."
"They won't notice anything—we haven't even been registered or searched. They've just gathered us up as they've come across us. We've been traveling for three days now, and I think more than twenty new prisoners have joined along the way."
"Where are we headed?"
"We're heading to Como, from where we'll travel by train to Milan," said the soldier and continued: "That's what I've heard from those who can understand American, but what happens after that, I don't know."
"We'll probably end up in some kind of camp where they can keep us locked up. They can't just let us wander around freely as long as the war isn't over yet."
"No, that's right, but as far as I'm concerned, the war is over. I count myself lucky that I've survived until now. There have been several close calls, but I've been fortunate and have only been slightly wounded a couple of times. But what about you—you're SS, and weren't you supposed to fight to the last drop of blood and never surrender?"
"That's right, but I'm done with the war just like you. Now it just needs to be over so we can have peace and return to the life we lived before the war. Besides, I don't think I owe anyone anything. I've been fighting since 1941, on all fronts, and like you, I've also been wounded a couple of times."
"I can hear you're not German," said the soldier, looking at Jens. "Where are you from?"
"I'm from Denmark."
"Shouldn't you have been on the Eastern Front then?" said the soldier, surprised. "That's where the Danish volunteers have been fighting all along, as far as I know."
"I enlisted directly in the SS and was never part of Frikorps Danmark. I enlisted because I was a fervent Nazi and anti-communist, and I couldn't wait for the Free Corps to be formed."
"I was stationed in Denmark for a longer period, right after we occupied the country," said the soldier dreamily. "It was a lovely place to be a soldier. Peace and quiet and plenty of food. The population was no danger to us at all—quite the opposite, actually. Many of the women liked a man in uniform, so we had no trouble finding female company. It was only later, when the Danes could see that we might lose the war, that they gradually began to resist. I suppose you're looking forward to going home?"
Jens thought for a moment and said: "Yes, I am, although I don't really know what to expect. I don't think those of us who fought on the German side in the war will escape punishment, and if the authorities find out what some of us did during the war, we'll probably get a harsh sentence."
Jens looked around at the soldiers he was walking with, and it was clear that they were completely worn down. Their faces were gaunt and haggard, their eyes looked tired and dull, and their shoulders slumped. The uniforms were almost completely worn out on many of them and were practically in tatters. It was obvious that this was a defeated army marching along.
Jens looked down at himself and could now see that his own uniform was also completely worn out. It was a miracle it was still holding together, but he couldn't remember when he had last received a new piece of uniform.
Jens straightened up and began to march a bit more briskly. As long as he was in uniform, he would behave like a soldier, if nothing else then for his own self-respect. He would not look like an old man, even though he felt infinitely tired and worn.


They walked for many hours along the road by the lake. Several times they passed through small villages where they were allowed to drink water from a public water pump, which was always placed in a central square.
Once they were given bread, and for Jens it was heavenly after so many days without any food other than a little dry cheese.
All the small towns lay more or less deserted. Only rarely could they see a curtain move and reveal that people actually lived there. It was as if the entire landscape was holding its breath, waiting for the war to end. Now it was just a matter of getting through the final period alive.
Jens thought about what the future would bring for him. He longed more and more for Denmark, but he didn't really have anything to go back to. His parents had died even before the war, and the only family he had left was a sister in Odense.
Where would he live? His sister had disowned him when he enlisted in the German military, so he couldn't expect any help there. Could he find work when he would certainly be regarded as a traitor?
He probably also faced a longer prison sentence that had to be served before he could begin to build a life. He had no education, and with the past that clung to him, he would only be able to get the hardest and worst-paid work.
All in all, it didn't seem very attractive to return to Denmark, but if he stayed in Germany, he would be living in a dirt-poor and bombed-out country where daily life would be a struggle to survive and find food and shelter.
Jens couldn't quite see what was best for him to do, so he began to think about the fortune he had just buried. He couldn't retrieve the treasure for the time being. There would certainly be people keeping an eye out for suspicious persons wandering around in the mountains by Lake Como. Such a large treasure couldn't be a complete secret, and someone would certainly start looking for it.
Jens trusted that the hiding place he had chosen was safe enough, so he just had to arm himself with patience and wait for several years before retrieving the treasure. Once he had the jewels, he would be financially secure and could settle anywhere in the world he wanted.
Jens had been lost in his own thoughts for a long time and hadn't really noticed where they were walking, but suddenly the large soldier said: "Well, we're finally approaching Como."
Jens looked around and could see that they were walking through a suburban area with two rows of houses along the road. Several of the houses were large palaces, and others resembled elegant hotels from a bygone era.
At one point they passed a park that lay along the lakeshore. The park was well-maintained and filled with green lawns, large shady trees, and flower beds that were all weeded and neatly raked. Jens thought about how lovely it was to see something nice and well-kept for once, instead of all the destruction he had witnessed in recent years.
They were now very close to the lake, and farther ahead they could glimpse a larger city. The column continued along the road by the lake, and it was clear that Como had once been a city filled with tourists.
There were many restaurants and hotels along the road, but they were all closed and just waiting for better times. There were no people to be seen in Como either. The streets lay deserted without any sign of life.
A way into the city, the column turned right and they walked through the narrow streets up to the station square, where they were ordered to halt.
The station was a long two-story concrete building with pink walls and an impressive entrance that filled more than half the building's width.
The American officer who commanded the column got out of the lead jeep and walked in through the entrance.
Shortly afterward he came out again, accompanied by a small Italian wearing a black cap, which indicated that he was employed by the railway. The Italian pointed and gesticulated, and finally it looked as though the American understood what he meant.
The officer now got back into the jeep, and the column moved along the road beside the railway for about a kilometer until they came to a large red warehouse. The German prisoners were ordered into the building, after which the gates were closed and locked.
Jens said to the large soldier, whom he still stayed close to: "Now we're really trapped. Let's hope they intend to treat us properly."
"I think they will—the war is almost over. I don't even know if there's still fighting in Italy, or if it's completely over now."
Jens said: "No, I'm not sure either, but there can't be much fighting strength left in us. Both supplies and ammunition must be almost exhausted by now. There haven't been any new supplies for the last month."
Suddenly one of the gates was thrown open, and buckets of water were placed on the floor along with some tin cups they could share. A little later, a table was set up with a lot of bread and some cheese on it. The prisoners were herded into line and received their food as their turn came.
When the food had been distributed, the gates were closed again. The prisoners sat down on the floor against the wall and rested after the long march. At first there was loud talking, but they were all exhausted from the long march they had been on, so it quickly grew quiet in the warehouse, and most of them fell asleep exhausted on the floor.
