Malene and Ole now followed the faint trail that led away from the road and into the scrub. The vegetation was low and consisted mostly of dry grass and creeping bushes, so they had no problems getting through.
After walking a couple of hundred meters, they came into a small wood where there was a clearing in the middle.
Malene said: "This could well look like a place where a house once stood."
Ole replied: "Yes, this looks right. Let's just look at the old map to see if the house was in a small wood."
Ole now took an iPad from the bag, and when the right image appeared on the screen, they could see that the house had actually been surrounded by forest on all sides, except the one facing down toward the valley.
Ole looked up from the screen and looked around. He said: "I'm quite sure this is the right place, it also matches the distance to the road, so now we just have to find the house. It must be here, but there's certainly nothing to see that could look like a house. It looks like the house has been torn down and all the building materials have been removed and probably reused elsewhere. If it had just been left to decay, there would be more left of it now. It's damned annoying that they were so thorough."
Malene said: "I think you're right. This must be the right place. If you walk around and look, I'll go back to the car and get the spade. If we use it to probe down into the ground, we should be able to find the house's foundation. It must still be here, even though everything else is gone."
Ole now walked around somewhat aimlessly, kicking at the grass while waiting for Malene. He was sure they would find the house, but it could take a bit of time.
The ground was full of stones, so it wouldn't be easy to detect the foundation, but they couldn't do anything other than get started and see if they could find stones lying in a row. That would be a sure sign that they had found the house.
A little later Malene came back with the spade, and they now began to probe it into the ground in various places that they thought could match the picture. However, it quickly turned out that Ole's fears were well-founded. The ground was so full of stones that they had to find another approach.
Malene said: "This isn't working. At this rate we could be searching for days before we find anything."
"You're right," Ole replied, "we'll have to dig away some of the earth so we can see the foundation. It's going to be a huge job, but there doesn't seem to be anything else to do."
"We could try making those search trenches like they use in archaeological surveys. Then we might be lucky to find something quickly."
They now took turns digging long narrow trenches crisscrossing the clearing. It was hard work in the heat, especially because the soil was completely matted with roots. But finally, after an hour of toil, Malene hit a couple of large stones lying in line with each other, and when she dug a bit more, she quickly uncovered enough to see that it was clearly the foundation they had finally found.
Malene said while wiping her forehead and catching her breath: "We finally did it. Now we just have to find the north corner. Do you have the compass?"
"No, it's in the car, but we can just use a mobile phone."
Ole got out his mobile phone and started the compass app. Once they had found the direction north, they could quickly dig the foundation free until they found the north corner.
Ole leaned on the spade and said: "So we've come this far. Now I finally feel like I can begin to glimpse the treasure."
"I feel the same way. Now we just have to hope there's something to find and it's not just a practical joke your uncle came up with."
"If that's what it is, they had a damn sick sense of humor in the old days. But let's just find the chest first, then we can see if it was worth all the trouble."
Malene thought for a moment before saying: "Jens wrote that we should go fifty meters due north. Jens wouldn't have had a measuring tape with him, so he probably means fifty long paces in a northerly direction."
"You're probably right. It's the only way he could have measured the distance. If only we knew how tall Jens was, we could roughly calculate his stride length."
"He was probably somewhere between your height and mine, so if we do it so that we each take fifty paces, the treasure is probably somewhere between where we end up."
"That sounds right, but shouldn't we wait until tomorrow to continue searching? It's getting late, and I'm actually quite tired after all that digging."
"OK. Then we'll pack up for today. We've come a long way. With a bit of luck, we should be able to find the treasure tomorrow."
Malene and Ole now drove back to the hotel at a leisurely pace. Both were tired after the hard work, but they were also excited about what they would find the next day. Both of them actually felt the treasure was almost at their feet, so they just had to pick it up the next day.
Malene said: "What do we actually do when we've dug up the treasure? We can't take it into the hotel. It would create a lot of attention if we come dragging in an old dirty chest."
"Jens did recommend transferring the jewels to bags, so I've bought some sturdy canvas bags. The chest is also too dangerous to keep. It's armored with a lot of explosives that will go off if anyone tries to open the chest without both keys. I've actually been thinking that if we find the treasure tomorrow, we'll put the jewels in the car and check out of the hotel the day after tomorrow. Then we'll drive home, and if we can handle it, we'll drive straight through without staying overnight at a hotel on the way."
"If we just take turns, we can surely manage to drive home in one go, but what about when we get home? Do you just want to have the jewels in the apartment?"
Ole sat thinking for a moment before saying: "Maybe we should rent a summer house somewhere. If we find one that's located a bit discreetly by itself, we can look at the treasure and agree on what to do with it without anyone seeing anything."
"That's a good idea. We can just book a summer house while we're driving north. There are lots of summer houses for rent around Zealand, so we should find something suitable. Maybe we can get a bit of beach vacation before summer is over."
"OK, I think we have a plan," said Ole laughing.
"We certainly do," replied Malene.
When they got back to the hotel, they both lay down to sleep for an hour, and instead of their usual walk along the lake, they just went down to the restaurant and ordered a drink before putting away a solid meal. They had both gotten quite tired from the hard work, so they could easily put away the full Italian menu from antipasti to dolce.
When they were done with the food, they both got an espresso and now just sat in silence and relaxed while enjoying the view over the water.
The next morning they were up early, and after picking up sandwiches and plenty of water bottles, they were quickly on their way up into the mountains again. They were both in high spirits and excited to see what the day would bring. Actually, neither of them doubted they would find the treasure before evening, so they were already in their minds on the way to a summer house in Denmark, where they could open the chest and finally see what it contained.
As they approached the place where they were to park the car, Malene said: "It's actually strange. I don't think I've seen the young waiter from the hotel or the street sweeper the last few days. The first few days I felt like we saw them all the time."
Suddenly a cold shiver ran down Ole's spine. However, he quickly composed himself and said: "It's probably just a coincidence. Here in tourist season they're guaranteed to be at work every day, but we just haven't run into them."
Ole got an uncomfortable feeling that they were in danger, but he quickly pushed it away again. Today was the big day when they would be rewarded for all their efforts, so he shouldn't ruin it by being in a bad mood.
Shortly afterward they parked the car and quickly set off along the path toward the house site. When they arrived, they quickly located the north corner, and as they had agreed, first Malene walked fifty paces and then Ole. On the last stretch, they both had to force their way through bushes and trees, which made it difficult both to keep the direction and get enough length in their strides.
Malene said: "Jens must have had the same problems as we have, don't you think? The trees and bushes certainly look like they've been here since the war."
"It was certainly the same for Jens, but we'll just expand the search a bit in both length and width, and we'll probably find it."
"You haven't by any chance come across a circular stone?"
"No, unfortunately. I'm afraid we'll probably have to find it the hard way, by digging like yesterday."
Malene sighed and said: "OK, then I'll start first and work my way up toward you."
Malene now dug a narrow trench like the ones they had made the day before, but after digging a couple of meters she had to take a break without having found anything but small stones.
Ole now started from his end with the same result, and after they had taken turns a couple of times, the trenches met without them having found anything resembling a large round stone.
Ole rested a bit on the spade and said: "We'll have to try to expand the search on both sides of where we've now dug."
Malene answered tiredly: "Yes, there doesn't seem to be anything else to do. It's going to be hard to have to dig two more trenches. I already feel like my arms are heavy as lead."
"We'll just dig at whatever pace we can manage. If we don't find the treasure today, we'll just start again tomorrow."
They now got to work digging, and after several hours of hard work, they had dug two new trenches, again without results. They had found nothing but small stones after digging through tough grass and roots from trees and bushes.
They were now both soaked with sweat and completely exhausted from the hard work.
Ole threw down the spade and said: "Now we'll take a long break. Find a spot in the shade, and I'll get food and water. We need to figure out how to approach this now."
Malene had found a spot in the shade where the ground was soft and the grass thick, so they could sit comfortably while eating their food. Neither of them really had an idea what they should do now.
They could of course continue to expand the search, but it just seemed so futile right now after the hard work they had done all morning. Finally they agreed that they would rest a bit before making decisions about how to proceed.
Malene fell asleep immediately, while Ole lay speculating to find a solution. Suddenly it struck him that Jens surely hadn't had a compass, so whether it was one corner or the other that faced north could be hard for him to determine. It must just be one of the corners that faced away from the valley.
Ole got up, took the spade, and went to the foundation again. It was as if he had gotten new strength, and he quickly uncovered the opposite corner so he could try walking the fifty paces in the new direction. When he had counted to fifty, he was standing exactly where Malene's head lay in the soft grass.
When Malene woke up a short time later and saw Ole's happy face, she said while looking sourly at him: "Why the hell are you so happy, we haven't found a damn thing, and we'll probably just have to keep digging all afternoon and for the next many days."
Ole now told her about his new theory, and without it helping her mood much, she got up, and Ole immediately started digging where they had been lying.
There were no large roots to dig through, so Ole quickly uncovered a large area, and suddenly he found what they had been looking for - a flat round stone.
The stone was heavy, but with joint effort they got it dug free and removed so they could dig in the soil underneath. Already after a couple of spadefuls, Ole hit something hard, and when they dug a bit free, they could see that they had found the curved lid of a chest.
Ole clenched his fists and raised them toward the sky as if in a victory rush: "Holy shit, Malene. We did it. We found the treasure." Malene threw her arms around his neck, and they danced around while cheering with joy and relief.
When they finally calmed down, they carefully dug the chest free all the way around and could now see that it appeared to be made of brass or another yellow metal. There was no decoration on the chest. Just a handle on each side and two keyholes in front.
Malene said: "Shall we see if we can get it out of the hole? It looks pretty heavy, but if Jens could carry it, surely we can too."
They now got down on their knees at each end of the hole and pulled with all their might, but it was as if the chest wouldn't let go of its grave. Ole now stuck the spade under the chest and tried to pry it loose. They had to try a couple of times before the chest finally released its grip on the earth, and they could get it lifted out of the hole.
Malene rubbed her aching back and said: "It's going smoothly. Now we just have to get the chest opened and distribute the jewels in the bags, and then we're on our way home again."
"Yes, it's been hard work the last few days, but in the end it went easily. I'll go up to the car and get the keys and bags so we can move on."
At that moment the waiter and street sweeper stepped forward from their hiding place among the trees, both with a pistol in hand.
The waiter said: "Thank you so much for your help. What a lot of work you've saved us. If you just do as we say, nothing will happen to you, but if you try to escape or make noise, you'll be shot on the spot."
Ole was now ordered to grab one handle of the chest while the street sweeper took hold of the other. The waiter held onto Malene's arm and held the pistol pressed into her side.
Together they now moved out to the road, where the chest was placed in the back seat of the Porsche. Malene and Ole were now commanded to sit down in the grass at the roadside while the street sweeper went to get the other car.
Ole was almost in shock, and he could see that Malene felt the same way. It had gone so well until everything suddenly turned upside down. Ole was sure they would be killed as soon as they were no longer useful, and right now he had no idea how they could get free. They were up against two strong young men, and they were also accustomed to handling weapons - they couldn't possibly win this unequal fight.
When the street sweeper came with the car, Malene had her hands tied behind her back, after which she was thrown into the back seat and the car continued down the mountain.
Ole was now told to sit in the driver's seat, and while the waiter directed the way, he constantly held his pistol pressed into Ole's side.
