CHAPTER 26

ITALY
2019


They found the trail just after nine in the morning—two weathered stones standing like gateposts at the road's edge, marking a path that had nearly vanished into the scrub.

"This is it," Malene said. "Has to be."

Ole studied the faint track winding between bushes and stunted trees. Seventy years of growth had almost erased it, but the bones of the old road were still visible—a slight depression in the terrain, stones that had once been a surface.

They followed it for two hundred meters until the brush opened into a clearing. The foundation was exactly where they'd left it—the north corner exposed, stones arranged in the unmistakable pattern of walls that had once held up a house.

"Fifty paces due north," Ole said, consulting his phone's compass. "That's where Jens said he buried it."

Malene looked at the dense vegetation between them and the indicated direction. "He wouldn't have had a compass. He was estimating. North-ish."

"So we each walk fifty paces from the corner. Wherever we end up defines our search area."

They started walking. The ground was uneven, choked with roots and rocks. Malene's path took her through a stand of scrub oaks. Ole pushed through waist-high grass.

When they stopped, forty meters separated them.

"Somewhere in between," Malene said.

Ole looked at the terrain—rough, overgrown, offering no obvious landmarks. "Let's start digging."


The trenches from yesterday crisscrossed the ground like scars. They'd found nothing but stones and roots. Now they expanded the search, cutting new channels through the soil, trading off with the spade when their arms gave out.

The sun climbed. Sweat soaked their clothes.

"This isn't working," Malene said after two hours. "We're guessing."

Ole leaned on the spade, breathing hard. "Jens didn't have a compass. He was navigating by the sun, by instinct. What if we're measuring from the wrong corner?"

"We picked north."

"North by compass. But what if Jens just meant the corner facing away from the valley? The corner pointing toward the mountains?"

Malene's eyes widened. "The opposite corner."

Ole was already moving. Back at the foundation, he uncovered the southeastern corner—the one facing away from where they'd been searching. He pulled out his phone, checked the direction, and started walking.

Fifty paces brought him to a patch of soft grass near a fallen tree. The exact spot where Malene had been resting the day before.

"Right here," he said. "The treasure is right here."


The first shovelful came up easy—no roots, no rocks. Just loose soil that had been disturbed before.

Two feet down, the blade struck something solid.

Ole's heart stopped. He dropped to his knees and began clearing earth with his hands, revealing curved metal beneath the dirt.

"Malene."

She was beside him in seconds, both of them digging now, fingers scraping soil away from the object beneath. A chest emerged—brass or bronze, tarnished but intact, handles on each side, two keyholes in the front.

"My God," Malene whispered. "It's real."

They dug around it, working the chest free from the earth that had held it for three-quarters of a century. When they finally pulled it from the hole, both of them were trembling.

Ole raised his fists to the sky. "We did it!"

Malene threw her arms around him, and they danced in the clearing, laughing, crying, overwhelmed by what they'd found.

Mussolini's diamonds.

After all this time.

After everything they'd been through.

Real.


"Let's get it to the car," Ole said, reaching for one of the handles. "We can open it at the hotel and—"

"I wouldn't do that."

The voice came from the tree line.

Two men stepped into the clearing. The waiter from the hotel. The street sweeper from Dongo. Both held pistols, and both pistols were pointed at Ole and Malene.

"Thank you for your hard work," the waiter said. "You've saved us considerable effort."

Ole's mind raced, but there was nothing to reach for, nowhere to run. They were caught.

"Hands where we can see them," the street sweeper added. "Away from the chest."

They backed away. The waiter approached the chest, running his hand over the lid, smiling at the keyholes.

"Two locks," he said. "And we know about the explosives inside. Very clever, these fascists. You'll need to give us the keys."

"We don't have them," Malene said.

The waiter's smile didn't waver. "That's unfortunate. For you." He pulled out his phone and made a call. A brief conversation in rapid Italian, then he pocketed the phone. "Signor Russo will be very interested to meet you. Both of you."

"Russo?" Ole felt the blood drain from his face. The elegant man from the beach bar. The charming Italian who'd bought them drinks and listened to their stories.

"You didn't think you were the only ones looking for this treasure, did you?" The waiter gestured with his pistol. "Now. Pick up the chest. We're going for a drive."


The street sweeper's car was waiting on the road—a battered Fiat that had seen better decades. The Porsche was exactly where they'd left it.

"The woman rides with us," the waiter said. "You"—he pointed at Ole—"will drive your car. And before you think about heroics, consider this: my colleague will have a gun against your girlfriend's head the entire time. Any tricks, any deviation from the route I give you, and she dies."

They bound Malene's hands behind her back and pushed her into the Fiat's rear seat. The street sweeper slid in beside her, pressing his pistol against her ribs.

Ole got behind the wheel of the Porsche. The waiter climbed into the passenger seat, his own weapon never wavering.

"Drive," the waiter said. "Down the mountain. I'll tell you where to turn."

Ole drove.

His mind churned through possibilities and found none. The pistol was inches from his side. Malene was in another car with another gun. Any sudden move, any attempt to crash or escape, and people would die.

He had to wait. Watch for an opportunity.

The Fiat followed close behind as they descended the mountain road, passed through the sleeping village of Garzeno, and continued down toward the lake. But instead of turning toward Dongo, the waiter directed him onto a smaller road that wound through forest and scrub.

After a kilometer, a house appeared—isolated, hidden from the road by dense vegetation. Exactly the kind of place where people could disappear.

"Stop here."

Both cars pulled into the small yard. The waiter and street sweeper pulled their prisoners from the vehicles, and together they walked toward what Ole was increasingly certain would be their grave.
