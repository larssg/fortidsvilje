CHAPTER 11

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK
June 2019


The motorway north was nearly empty on this Sunday morning, the sun climbing through a cloudless sky. Ole kept the Porsche at a steady 120, the engine purring behind him, the world sliding past in a blur of green fields and blue sky.

He'd gotten comfortable behind the wheel. It had taken weeks of practice—nervous drives through country lanes, sweaty-palmed attempts at highway merging, one memorable near-miss in a parking garage—but now he felt like he belonged here. The car responded to his inputs like an extension of his body.

Malene sat in the passenger seat, watching the scenery. "You're getting good at this."

"I'm getting adequate at this."

"Same thing, for a man who hadn't driven in years." She smiled. "Ready for the autobahn?"

"Absolutely not."

"You'll be fine. Just stay in the right lane and let the Germans sort themselves out."

They were heading to Hornbæk, a beach town on the northern coast. A test run, of sorts—seeing how far they could drive in a day, how the car handled on winding roads, how they worked together as a team.

Three weeks until Italy.

Ole tried not to think about what waited for them there.


The road wound through forests and fields, past farms and manor houses, through villages with cobblestone squares and half-timbered houses. Denmark in early summer—everything green and golden and impossibly beautiful.

"I love this country," Malene said. "Especially on days like today."

"It's not bad."

"Not bad? Look around you. This is paradise."

"Paradise with a treasure buried in Italy."

She laughed. "Fair point. Though if we find the treasure, we could buy a lot of paradise."

They found parking near the harbor in Hornbæk and walked along the marina, looking at the boats. Fishing vessels and pleasure craft, wooden sailboats and modern catamarans. The water sparkled in the sun.

"I could buy a boat," Ole said. "If this works out."

"You could buy a fleet."

"I don't want a fleet. I want one boat. Something small, something simple. I'd sail it around the Danish coast, anchor in quiet harbors, read books and drink wine."

"Sounds lonely."

"Maybe." He glanced at her. "Depends on the company."

Malene didn't respond, but she didn't look away either.


They found a restaurant with a garden overlooking the harbor—white tablecloths, fresh flowers, a view of the water. The waiter brought menus and cold beers, and they sat in comfortable silence, enjoying the warmth of the sun.

"I've been meaning to tell you something," Malene said.

Ole felt his stomach tighten. "What?"

"I've had a feeling lately. Like I'm being watched." She stirred her beer absently. "I know how it sounds. But I keep seeing the same faces—two men, I think. At the school, near my apartment, on the street. It's probably nothing."

"How long?"

"A few weeks. Since I booked the hotel, roughly."

Ole set down his beer. "That's... concerning."

"Or it's paranoia. Stress. The excitement of what we're planning." She shrugged, but there was tension in her shoulders. "I've never felt like this before. It's unsettling."

"Have you seen anyone today?"

"No. But I wasn't looking."

Ole thought about Jens's letter. The warnings about others searching for the treasure. The admonition to be careful.

"We should pay attention," he said. "Both of us. Keep track of faces, patterns. If there really is someone watching you, they might be watching me too."

"And if we find evidence?"

"Then we reassess. The treasure isn't worth our lives."

Malene nodded slowly. "Agreed. But let's not panic yet. It could be nothing."

"It could be." Ole picked up his menu. "Now—what are you eating?"


The food was excellent. Fish cakes with lobster sauce for Malene, steak tartare for Ole. They ate slowly, talking about everything except the treasure—work, friends, memories from their time together years ago.

It felt almost normal. Almost like a real date, rather than a planning session for an international crime.

"Do you ever think about what went wrong?" Ole asked. "With us, I mean. Before."

Malene considered the question. "We were too similar, maybe. Both stubborn. Both convinced we were right."

"We probably were right. Just about different things."

"That's the problem with stubborn people." She smiled. "We find it very hard to compromise."

"And now?"

"Now I'm older. Hopefully wiser." She met his eyes. "I've learned that being right isn't always the most important thing."

"What is?"

"Being happy. Being with people who matter." She looked away, toward the water. "I've spent too many years alone, Ole. Working, achieving, proving myself. And what do I have to show for it? A career. An apartment. No one to share any of it with."

Ole reached across the table and touched her hand. "You have me."

"Do I?"

"For what it's worth."

She didn't pull away. They sat like that for a moment, hands touching, the sun warm on their faces.

"Let's find the treasure first," Malene said finally. "Then we can figure out the rest."


They spent the afternoon at Frederiksborg Castle—a Renaissance palace on an island in the middle of a lake, all red brick and copper spires and formal gardens. Malene had never been, despite being a historian. Ole teased her about it mercilessly.

"The Museum of National History, and you've never visited? What kind of historian are you?"

"The kind who studies World War II, not the Danish Renaissance."

"Still. It's embarrassing."

They walked through the galleries, admiring the portraits and tapestries, the gilded ceilings and marble floors. The castle had burned in 1859 and been rebuilt as a museum—a monument to Danish history, preserved in amber.

"I wonder what they'll say about our era," Malene said. "Centuries from now. Whether they'll remember any of us."

"They'll remember the wars. The disasters. The famous people."

"And the rest of us will be forgotten."

"Unless we find a treasure and become legends ourselves."

She laughed. "The Danish treasure hunters. I like the sound of that."


The drive back to Copenhagen was quiet. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, and the fields glowed golden in the fading light.

"I've been thinking about the route," Malene said. "Maybe we should go through Odense. See your father's house before the new owners take over."

"It's empty now. The Salvation Army took everything."

"I know. But still—don't you want to see it one more time? The place where you grew up? The crawl space where you found the suitcase?"

Ole thought about it. He hadn't been back since the funeral. Hadn't wanted to face the empty rooms, the memories, the life his father had lived without him.

"All right," he said. "We'll go through Odense. One last visit."

"And then Lübeck for the first night?"

"Lübeck. Then Koblenz." He glanced at her. "We should find Florinspfaffengasse while we're there. See if the Fleischer family still lives there."

Malene's expression hardened slightly. "We're not contacting them yet."

"I know. Just reconnaissance."

"Fine. But we don't make promises we can't keep. Not until we know what we're actually working with."

Ole let it go. The question of the Fleischer family could wait. Everything could wait until they knew whether the treasure was real.


They reached Copenhagen as the last light faded from the sky. Ole navigated through the evening traffic to the garage on Heimdalsgade, pulling the Porsche into its space with only a minor heart palpitation.

"You're getting better at that," Malene observed.

"Practice makes adequate."

They walked back toward the metro station, passing through streets that were coming alive with the Sunday evening crowd—couples heading to dinner, groups of students spilling out of bars, the usual chaos of a city in summer.

"Three weeks," Malene said. "Then we'll know."

"Then we'll know."

She stopped at the entrance to the metro station and turned to face him. "Keep your eyes open, Ole. Watch for anything suspicious. And call me if you see anything—anything at all."

"I will."

"I mean it. We're not being paranoid if there really is something to be paranoid about."

She disappeared down the stairs before he could respond.

Ole stood on the sidewalk for a moment, watching the crowds flow past. Normal people, living normal lives. Any one of them could be watching him. Or none of them.

He started walking home.


The evening was warm, and Ole decided to stop for a beer at an outdoor café. He found a table in the sun and ordered a Tuborg, watching the world go by.

He thought about the trip ahead. Berlin. Koblenz. Como. Dongo. A little town he'd never heard of until a few weeks ago, and now the center of everything.

He thought about Malene. About the way she'd looked at him over lunch, the way her hand had felt under his. Something was changing between them. Or maybe something old was coming back to life.

He thought about the treasure. Two hundred and fifty million euros, buried in the Italian mountains for seventy-five years. Waiting for someone to dig it up.

Waiting for him.

The beer arrived. Ole drank it slowly, enjoying the cold bite on his tongue. The sun was setting now, the shadows lengthening across the cobblestones.

He didn't notice the young man who sat down at a table across the terrace. Didn't notice the way the man watched him without appearing to watch. Didn't notice when the man followed him home at a careful distance, noting his address in a small notebook.

Ole was thinking about the future.

He didn't see the danger gathering in the present.


Back in his apartment, he called Malene.

"I've been thinking about the overnight stops," he said. "Maybe Lübeck instead of Berlin. It's smaller—we can actually see it in a day."

"I like that idea. And it's on the way."

"I'll book the hotels tonight. Lübeck, then Koblenz, then... wherever we end up."

"Book something nice in Koblenz. We might need to do some research there."

"The Fleischer family."

"If they still exist. If they're still there." She paused. "Ole?"

"Yes?"

"I know I've been difficult about this. The question of sharing the treasure. But I want you to know—I'm not heartless. If we find Paul Fleischer's descendants, if we can verify who they are... we'll do the right thing."

"The right thing being...?"

"I don't know yet. But we'll figure it out. Together."

Ole smiled. "Together. I like the sound of that."

"Don't get too comfortable. We still have to actually find the treasure."

"Details."

She laughed. "Goodnight, Ole. Keep your eyes open."

"You too."

He hung up and stood at the window, looking out at the city. Somewhere out there, a young man in a bomber jacket was making a phone call, reporting Ole's address to someone far away.

But Ole didn't know that.

He was thinking about diamonds. About Malene. About the adventure that was about to begin.

Three weeks.

Everything would change in three weeks.
