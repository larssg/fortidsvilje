Copenhagen 2019


The motorway toward Helsingør was almost free of cars on this spring Sunday, with the sun shining from a cloudless sky. Ole sat behind the wheel of the Porsche and enjoyed hearing the deep rumble from the large engine. Somehow, it was nice to know that he had access to a lot of horsepower.
He had gradually become completely comfortable with driving the car, which actually wasn't much different to handle than an ordinary car. You just had to be careful not to press too hard on the accelerator, because then things got very fast very quickly.
In the first period after he had taken over the car, he had started with small drives on the country roads north of Copenhagen, so he could build up some routine. It had been many years since he had driven a car, but he quickly got the hang of it, and soon he was the one behind the wheel on the trips he and Malene took.
The only thing he still didn't really like was driving the car into the garage. The entrance was very narrow, and he constantly had the feeling that there wasn't enough space, but now he had done it a couple of times, and it had gone fine without scratching the car even once.
Malene, who was sitting in the passenger seat, smiled and said: "It's going really well now. We're probably almost ready to drive south. You're quick to learn how to drive. It's nice that we can take turns driving, because it's a long trip we're going on."
"Yes, I think I'm getting the hang of it too. As long as it doesn't go too fast, it's fine."
"You just have to follow the traffic, and it will go smoothly. When we get to Germany, it's different, because there's no speed limit in many places. But you can just stay in the inner or middle lane depending on whether it's a two or three-lane motorway we're driving on."
"We'll see," said Ole a bit hesitantly. "Maybe you should just drive the car all the way through Germany. That's probably the safest. You've also talked about how it might be fun to try driving really fast in the car, and I definitely don't want any part of that."
Malene said: "Stop being such a scaredy-cat. Once we get going, you'll definitely want to try driving fast. You should also remember that the car is designed to go really fast in a safe way."
They now drove on in silence while enjoying the good weather. They had planned to drive to Hornbæk, so shortly before Helsingør, they turned off toward Tikøb and Hornbæk. The road now wound beautifully through forests and small villages, with views of many small farms and houses that all looked beautiful and well-maintained. On several stretches they drove along lilac hedges, which with their rich abundance of blue and white flowers, together with the clear sunshine, made the trip seem quite magical at times.
"Denmark really is a beautiful country," said Malene, looking at the landscape with a smile. "On a day like today it's just so lovely when you get a bit away from the main roads. That's one of the advantages of having a car—you can easily get around and see all the beautiful things."
"Yes, it definitely has its advantages to have a car if you're going on longer trips. I certainly never missed having a car in all the years I've lived in Copenhagen. There's so much public transport, and with a good bicycle, you can quickly get around the whole city."
"Should we see if we can find a place to have lunch in Hornbæk? There must be several places, with all the tourists who come to the town."
"It's not high season yet, so maybe not everything has opened, but there should be a couple of places where we can get something to eat."
"I'll try looking on Tripadvisor. I can quickly see where there's good food and whether it's open now," said Malene and took out her phone.
"When we get into town, I think we should first drive down to the harbor and look at the water and the boats. The weather is perfect for a little walk."
Malene looked up from her phone and said: "Good idea, let's do that. Now I've also found a good place to eat. It gets really good reviews, and it's on the way down to the harbor, so we'll pass by on the way."


A little later they drove into Hornbæk, where they followed the signs to the harbor. They passed the usual galleries, real estate agents, and souvenir kiosks that are apparently standard fixtures in all Danish beach towns from Gedser to Skagen.
It was still off-season, so the town wasn't crowded with tourists. They therefore easily found a parking space in the small square down by the marina. In the middle of the square there was a strange pole with a lot of signs advertising local businesses. Obviously a relic from some kind of fundraiser, but it wasn't exactly pretty to look at.
Malene and Ole walked around the harbor a bit and looked at the boats, which were now all in the water. The harbor wasn't large and was quickly seen. They therefore agreed that it must now be time for a bite of lunch.
After a brisk walk they came to the restaurant, which was a converted villa with pink walls and a lovely little garden in front.
Ole and Malene went into the restaurant and were immediately shown to a table by the window facing the street. The waiter came with menus right away, and after some deliberation they ordered lunch.
Malene ordered fish cakes with lobster bisque, and Ole ordered steak tartare. They both got a large draft beer and were now ready to relax for the next hour or so and just let themselves be waited on.
The beers came to the table immediately, and shortly afterward the food also arrived. The food was good, beautifully presented, and well-prepared, so they ate with good appetites while chatting about this and that.


When they had finished eating, they both sat relaxing with the last of the beer in their glasses. Just as they were chatting about various things, Malene leaned across the table and looked Ole firmly in the eyes while she said: "I've had such a strange feeling that I'm being watched. It's actually quite unpleasant. I haven't discovered anything concrete, but I think I've seen the same two men several times recently. It seems a bit like they're keeping an eye on me. I think I've seen them both out at the gymnasium and at home by the apartment. It could be something I'm imagining, but it's still strange."
Ole looked at her a bit startled: "I haven't noticed anything, and if it has something to do with the treasure, I should probably also be under surveillance?"
"Yes, you would think so, but maybe they haven't discovered you yet. It could be that someone became aware of me when I booked the stay in Dongo."
Ole placed his hand reassuringly on Malene's and said: "That sounds very strange. Then there would have to be someone constantly watching who books into hotels in Dongo and then subsequently putting surveillance on them. That's a completely impossible task. Don't you think it's just because you're a bit stressed? It is a most unusual adventure we're going on. I've certainly never imagined that I would go out looking for a buried treasure."
Malene said, shuddering a little: "Yes, it could be that I'm a bit worked up, but it's still strange. I've never felt like this before."
Ole thought about it for a moment and had to agree with Malene that she was normally a calm and down-to-earth woman who didn't go around imagining all sorts of dangers and misfortunes that could befall her. So if she had suddenly become anxious because she felt someone was watching her, there might be something to it.
Ole said: "Let's just calm down and not get too worked up. Can we agree that for the next while you'll keep a close eye on whether there really is someone watching you? I admittedly haven't noticed anything yet, but I'll also start keeping an eye out. If after a week or so we don't have anything concrete to hang the suspicion on, then it's probably just the excitement playing tricks on you."
"We can agree on that," said Malene and continued in a firm voice, "but if we discover something, I think we should cancel the trip this summer. Jens Raben also wrote that we should be careful because there were certainly others who were also after the treasure. The jewels are so valuable that many would probably kill to get their hands on them."
"I agree with you on that, although I would be annoyed not to go down for the treasure, but we shouldn't risk our lives—the treasure isn't that valuable. Let's just enjoy today with this lovely weather. What do you say to driving to Frederiksborg Castle? I haven't seen it since I was there with school many years ago."
"Good idea. I've actually never been to Frederiksborg Castle, I must admit. It's a bit embarrassing for a historian."
Ole smiled and said: "Well then, let's get going so we can remedy your lack of education."
They got up from the table, and Ole went up to the bar and paid the bill, after which they went down to the harbor, got into the car, and drove toward Hillerød.
They spent a lovely afternoon visiting the castle, where they saw many paintings and interiors from the last 500 years of Danish history. The castle was beautifully restored, and it wasn't possible to tell that it had almost completely burned down in 1859.


On the way home they chose to follow the small country roads as far as possible. They weren't in a hurry and could better enjoy the car and the good weather when the pace was moderate.
As they approached the parking garage, Malene said: "We're leaving for Italy in 3 weeks. Have you thought about where we should stay overnight on the way? I'm not in favor of driving down in one stretch. I think that would be too hard. Neither of us is used to driving very far."
"I've actually been thinking that we could stay overnight in Berlin and then in Koblenz on the way down. In Koblenz we can scout around and see if we can find Paul Fleischer's family. If nothing else, we can probably find the street Jens wrote about in the letter."
Malene thought about it: "I don't think it's a good idea to contact them before we've found the treasure. They'll just be terribly disappointed if we don't find anything after all."
"I agree. We'll just find the street and with a bit of luck maybe also the family, but we won't contact them initially. I'll book 2 hotels for the trip to Italy. Let's wait to book for the return trip—we don't know how things will develop."
Malene said: "What have you actually done with Jens's suitcase? Do you just have it sitting in the apartment?"
"No, I've rented a large safety deposit box at the bank where I've hidden it. I considered throwing everything out except the diamonds, but I couldn't bring myself to do it."
"Good that it's stored away. What about the letter? It absolutely must not fall into the wrong hands. It indicates how to find the jewels."
"I've destroyed the letter after I wrote down key points from it on two pieces of paper. What I wrote won't make sense to anyone but us. One piece of paper is in the suitcase, and the other I have here in my wallet."
Malene said curiously: "Can I see what you've written?"
"I'll show you when we've parked the car," said Ole.
They now drove through Copenhagen's streets until they reached the parking garage, where Ole again managed to maneuver the car into place in the parking space.
Ole turned off the engine, took out the key, and pulled the handbrake. Then he leaned back in the seat, clearly relieved to have managed the task of parking the car again. It was fortunately getting easier each time.
Ole now took out his wallet and showed Malene the piece of paper that reproduced Jens's letter in coded form.
On the paper it said:
Kobl.  Florin Pfga
Garzeno square e. h. 1 k. MT
n. c. N. 50 m R stone
Malene looked long and concentratedly at the paper. Clearly in doubt about what it all meant. Ole could recognize the furrow she always got on her forehead when she was really thinking hard, so the note was clearly giving her difficulties.
Finally she said: "I think the first line means: Koblenz Florinspfaffengasse. That's where we need to find Paul's family. The second line means: Go to Garzeno look east in the square, then there's a house one kilometer away. I don't know what MT means."
"The first line was completely right. In the second line you're missing MT, which means mountaintop. What about the last line?"
Malene chewed on it for a long time, then said hesitantly: "I think it means: North corner. Walk north 50 meters and find a round stone. Underneath is the treasure."
"Completely right. This little note is enough for us to find the treasure, but I don't think it would make sense if you hadn't read the letter. Don't you agree?"
"I definitely don't think the note would make sense if you hadn't read the letter. I had a hard enough time deciphering the note even though I had read it."
"The only uncertain thing is perhaps that Garzeno is mentioned clearly," said Ole, frowning, "but that's probably the only thing that would make sense. Could you take a picture of the note with your phone? Then you'll also have a copy in case mine gets lost."
Malene took out her mobile phone and took a picture of the note, after which they got out of the car and left the parking garage.
A little later they came to the metro station where Malene was to catch her train, and after a hug goodbye Malene said: "Remember to keep an eye out for whether you're being watched or if other mysterious things happen. Call me if there's anything."
"I'll keep watch," said Ole, "but I can't imagine there's anything to worry about already. We haven't even left Denmark yet."
"I hope it's just me being a bit stressed, but as I said, I've never had a feeling of being watched before, and it's actually quite unpleasant. You walk around looking over your shoulder all the time."
"I can well understand that it must be very unpleasant, and I promise you I'll keep watch," said Ole. "If I observe anything, I'll call you immediately."
They now went their separate ways. Malene went down into the metro station and Ole began to walk home.


It was getting toward late afternoon, but the weather was lovely, and Ole walked briskly. He was in a good mood after the lovely day with a wonderful car and good company. Ole wondered if perhaps there was a possibility that he and Malene could get back together as more than just friends. The thought actually appealed to him a lot, but he didn't really have a sense of how Malene viewed the matter. Well, it might develop on the trip to Italy—they would be together all the time for many days.
Ole came past a cafe with outdoor seating where people were sitting and enjoying themselves in the sun, and he decided to enjoy the light and warmth. He needed it after a long, dark winter.
There was an empty table right in the sun, and Ole sat down there and waited to be served. He didn't notice the young man who sat down at a table at the other end of the seating area.
When the waiter came to the table, Ole ordered a large Tuborg draft beer. He didn't feel like the heavier specialty beers that he otherwise usually drank. Now he just wanted something ice-cold and refreshing, and he looked forward to the white foam head and the condensation beading down the sides of the glass.
It was a shame he hadn't invited Malene for a beer, but it wasn't until he passed the cafe that he got the idea for a really good ending to the day. Ole considered for a brief moment calling Malene, but she was already almost home, so he quickly gave up on that idea.
The young man, who was neatly dressed in brown leather shoes, black jeans, a polo shirt, and a bomber jacket, ordered a cup of coffee and looked around at the other guests at the cafe with apparent disinterest.
Ole sat enjoying his beer in peace and quiet, but he was thinking about what work tasks he needed to complete before the summer holiday. It was now exam time, and he had one class left to examine and was to be an external examiner for two others.
The exam days were fortunately spread evenly over the next three weeks, so it was definitely not a stressful schedule he had ahead of him. There should be plenty of time to plan the trip to Italy and also time to take some drives in the car.
All in all, he had good reason to be in a good mood, but when he thought about the problems he and Malene might run into, he could see some dark clouds on the horizon.
First of all, they had to find the treasure, and even though it had sounded quite simple and straightforward in Jens's letter, perhaps it wasn't so easy after all. The house they were supposed to find could have been torn down many years ago, and the plot might have become completely overgrown with forest.
Secondly, he couldn't quite see how they were going to transport the jewels down from the mountain. Jens had written that the chest weighed about 25 kilos, but not how much the jewels weighed. But it could probably be managed with a backpack. The important thing was not to attract unnecessary attention.
Thirdly, Ole couldn't imagine how they were going to find Paul's family so they could hand over half of the valuables. They couldn't very well just knock on doors. It wasn't even certain that anyone could remember Paul Fleischer now more than 70 years after his death.
The family could also have moved from the address many years ago, and perhaps no one could remember where they had moved to.
Ole thought about Malene's suspicion that they were being watched. It sounded almost too fantastic for him to take seriously. She had done nothing but book a hotel stay in a town that was obviously full of tourists in the summer. How that could attract attention was beyond his comprehension. On the other hand, it was true that Jens had warned them that there were certainly others who were also after the treasure and that they should be careful.
Perhaps they should have just booked a hotel in another town some distance from Dongo—they could easily drive to the town in the car. Well, it was too late now in any case—the hotel was booked. They would just have to be more careful from now on and keep an eye on whether anyone was taking a bit too much interest in what they were doing.
Ole shook off the dark thoughts and enjoyed the sun while he drank the last of his beer. When he was finished, he called the waiter, paid, and began walking home again. He didn't notice that the young man also got up and followed him at a distance of a couple of hundred meters.
On the way, Ole was thinking about whether they should perhaps take the first overnight stay in Lübeck instead of Berlin. He had always wanted to visit Lübeck, and it was such a small city that they could get an impression of it in a single day. A single day's stay in Berlin didn't really make sense with all the sights the city had to offer.
He would discuss it with Malene when he got home and then get the hotel rooms booked.
When Ole was home, he went up to his apartment and opened a few windows to let some of the heat out. He didn't notice that the young man standing down on the street carefully noted Ole's exact address.
Ole called Malene and presented her with the idea of changing travel plans, and she was immediately on board.
Malene said: "That's a really good idea. Then we can also drive to Germany via Funen, so you can show me your childhood home."
"We can do that, but it's a bit empty now. The new owners take over the house in a month, and all the contents have been picked up by the Salvation Army."
Malene said: "It doesn't matter. I'd like to see the house and the crawl space where you found the suitcase."
"OK," said Ole, "then we'll go to Lübeck via Odense on the first day. It should be a nice trip."
